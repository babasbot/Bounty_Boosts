# Incorrect implementation of EIP-712 domain separator construction 

Submitted on Mar 4th 2024 at 13:58:49 UTC by @cheatcode for [Boost | eBTC](https://immunefi.com/bounty/ebtc-boost/)

Report ID: #29002

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://github.com/ebtc-protocol/ebtc/blob/release-0.7/packages/contracts/contracts/BorrowerOperations.sol

Impacts:
- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)

## Description
## Brief/Intro
See below

## Vulnerability Details
EIP-712 provides a standard for signing typed structured data in Ethereum smart contracts, using the concept of domain separation to prevent collisions and replay attacks. 

A key component of validation is the domain separator, which uniquely identifies the specific contract and chain for message signing purposes. The domain separator is constructed from:

- **DOMAIN_TYPEHASH**: The keccak256 hash of the EIP-712 domain schema definition itself (the actual string types used like name, version etc.) 

- **Contract Specific Values**: Domain values like name, version, chain ID and contract address.

In the current contract, the `_TYPE_HASH` variable used in the domain separator construction does not match the expected `DOMAIN_TYPEHASH`. Upon closer inspection, it is aligned closer to the hash of the full message type itself rather than the domain type schema.

## Impact Details
While this does not directly introduce security vulnerabilities per se, it indicates a gap in properly differentiating between DOMAIN_TYPEHASH and actual message TYPEHASH as EIP-712 expects

## Proof of Concept

This could lead to the following issues:

- Domain separators constructed incorrectly as per standards
- Signatures validated against such separators fail externally 
- Mismatched assumptions between contract and clients
- Confusing for future audit and maintenance

**Recommendations**

1. Introduce a properly defined DOMAIN_TYPEHASH constant

2. Construct domain separator by passing DOMAIN_TYPEHASH and contract-specific values

3. Optionally validate both DOMAIN_TYPEHASH and message TYPEHASH on chain 

This will greatly improve standards compliance, clarity and future security.
