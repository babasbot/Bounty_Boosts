Report ID: #33644

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x8F27355662D6de024FEE83b176dD8DB1F2CA1585/

Impacts:
- Protocol insolvency

## Description
## Brief/Intro
According to the Wormhole documentation, the sending function implementation must ensure the correct amount of `msg.value` was passed in to send the token and the payload. However, both in `WormholeDataAdapter` and `WormholeCCTPAdapter`do not check this properly.

## Vulnerability Details
The `getSendFee()` function in both Wormhole adapters uses `quoteEVMDeliveryPrice()` function to determine the cost of sending the message.

As stated in [this](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/quick-start/tutorials/hello-token#implement-sending-function) article from the official Wormhole documentation the `wormhole.messageFee()` MUST be accounted for as it may change from 0 in the future. 

```solidity
   function getSendFee(Messages.MessageToSend memory message) external view override returns (uint256 fee) {
        // get chain adapter if available
        (uint16 wormholeChainId, , ) = getChainAdapter(message.destinationChainId);

        // get cost of message to be sent
        (fee, ) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
            wormholeChainId,
            message.params.receiverValue,
            message.params.gasLimit
        );
    }
```

The `BridgeRouter` contract sends `fee` amount of gas tokens, even if `msg.value > fee`:
```solidity
 uint256 fee = adapter.getSendFee(message);

        // check if have sufficient funds to pay fee (can come from existing balance and/or msg.value)
        bytes32 userId = _getUserId(Messages.decodeActionPayload(message.payload));
        uint256 userBalance = balances[userId];

        if (msg.value + userBalance < fee) revert NotEnoughFunds(userId);

        // update user balance considering fee and msg.value
        balances[userId] = userBalance + msg.value - fee;

        // call given adapter to send message
@>      adapter.sendMessage{ value: fee }(message);
```
Because of this, sending more `msg.value` to account for this additional fee is impossible - it'll be always the value returned by `getSendFee()`.

## Impact Details
When Wormhole updates the message fee to be != 0,  the `fee` sent to the Wormhole Adapters will be insufficient leading to all Wormhole-based cross-chain messages failing ( both data-only and CCTP token transfers).

Although this vulnerability strictly requires Wormhole protocol to change a parameter, their docs explicitly warn any integrations that this might happen and present the correct way of calculating the delivery fee:
```
// Total cost: delivery cost +
    // cost of publishing the 'sending token' wormhole message
    cost = deliveryCost + wormhole.messageFee();
```
Therefore, critical severity is justified because in case of this *predictable* change, all cross-chain messages from spoke chains compatible with only the Wormhole adapter will fail.

## Proof of concept
## Proof of Concept
Considering that the Wormhole Relayer is responsible for paying the fee to the Delivery Provider, to avoid complex integrations with cross-chain messaging `sendToEvm()` function in the `MockWormholeRelayer` will be changed to simulate this process:
 ```diff
 function sendToEvm(
        uint16 targetChain,
        address targetAddress,
        bytes memory payload,
        uint256 receiverValue,
        uint256 paymentForExtraReceiverValue,
        uint256 gasLimit,
        uint16 refundChain,
        address refundAddress,
        address deliveryProviderAddress,
        VaaKey[] memory vaaKeys,
        uint8 consistencyLevel
    ) external payable override returns (uint64 sequence) {
+      uint deliveryFee = msg.value + 0.01e18;
+      require(msg.value >= deliveryFee, "insufficient payment");
        emit WormholeSendVaaKey(
            targetChain,
            targetAddress,
            payload,
            receiverValue,
            paymentForExtraReceiverValue,
            gasLimit,
            refundChain,
            refundAddress,
            deliveryProviderAddress,
            vaaKeys,
            consistencyLevel
        );
        return _sequence;
    }
```
where the `deliveryFee` is increased by `0.01e18` - arbitrary value for `wormhole.messageFee`.  Obviously, calling this function will always fail, that's a simplification of what would be checked when the delivery fee is paid to the delivery provider.

To call this function run:
```shell
npx hardhat test --grep "Should successfuly send immediate finality message"
```
which will run a test case from `WormholeDataAdapter.test.ts`. It'll always fail, note that this "ever-failing" check makes sense because `msg.value` is *always* equal to the return value of `getSendFee()`.
