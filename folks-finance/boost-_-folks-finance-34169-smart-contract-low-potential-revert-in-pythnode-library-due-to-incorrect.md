Report ID: #34169

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Low

Target: https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xA758c321DF6Cd949A8E074B22362a4366DB1b725

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Description
In the `PythNode` library's `process` function, there's a potential issue with the price calculation logic when dealing with negative exponents from Pyth price feeds. The function attempts to convert a potentially negative `int256` value to `uint256` using the `SafeCast.toUint256()` method, which will always revert for negative inputs.

See:  https://github.com/Folks-Finance/folks-finance-xchain-contracts/blob/main/contracts/oracle/nodes/PythNode.sol  
```solidity
uint256 price = factor > 0
    ? pythData.price.toUint256() * (10 ** factor.toUint256())
    : pythData.price.toUint256() / (10 ** factor.toUint256());
```

When `factor` is negative, the second branch is executed, attempting to convert `factor` to `uint256`. This conversion will invariably fail for negative values, causing the transaction to revert.  

See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol#L567-L579

**Note**: `PythNode` library is a part of `NodeManager.sol` (in-scope asset).  

## Impact
The impact of this issue is that it will cause a revert in the `process` function when dealing with price feeds that result in a negative `factor`.

## Rationale for Severity
The severity of this issue is considered **Low** for the following reasons:

1. This branch might be unreachable in the first place as it requires < -18 exponent return from a Pyth node, which is currently non-existent.
2. The affected price feeds might not be integrated with the protocol.

Despite the two reasons mentioned, it's still a techically valid bug and should be fixed.  
        
## Proof of concept
## Proof-of-Concept
### Requirement
- chisel 0.2.0 (3ae4f50 2024-07-07T00:21:48.451168337Z)  

### Steps
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Folks-Finance/folks-finance-xchain-contracts.git`  
2. Run `cd folks-finance-xchain-contracts`  
3. Run `chisel` inside the directory  

4. Run below code, **line by line** in the REPL
```
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol";
using SafeCast for int256;
int256 factor = -1;
factor.toUint256();
```
5. Observe that it reverts when trying to convert `factor` to `uint256`
