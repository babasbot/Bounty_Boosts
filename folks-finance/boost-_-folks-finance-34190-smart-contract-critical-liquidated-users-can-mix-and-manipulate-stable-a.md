## Description
## Brief/Intro
Users can mix their ```UserLoanBorrow``` with both stable and variable borrowings manipulating a check on ```LiquidationLogic``` and, in this way, pay less interest and mess up ```HubPool``` accountings.

## Vulnerability Details
During the liquidation process in Folks Finance, there is a critical check within the ```prepareLiquidation``` function of the ```LiquidationLogic``` contract. This check ensures that the borrowings of the liquidated user (violator) cannot be transferred to the liquidator's ```UserLoanBorrow``` account if the liquidator already has an active debt of a different borrowing type (stable or variable). The relevant code snippet is shown below:
```solidity
function prepareLiquidation(
        // ...
    ) external returns (DataTypes.LoanLiquidityParams memory violatorLiquidity) {
        // ...

        bool isViolatorStableBorrow = violatorLoanBorrow.stableInterestRate > 0;
        bool isLiquidatorStableBorrow = liquidatorLoanBorrow.stableInterestRate > 0;
@>        if (liquidatorLoanBorrow.amount > 0 && isViolatorStableBorrow != isLiquidatorStableBorrow)
            revert BorrowTypeMismatch(loansParams.violatorLoanId, loansParams.liquidatorLoanId, borrPoolId);

        // ...
    }
```
This code snippet ensures that if the liquidator already has an active borrowing, he cannot combine it with the violatorâ€™s borrowing if the types differ.

However, an exploit exists where the liquidator can have ```liquidatorLoanBorrow.amount == 0``` while still having an active borrowing balance, thereby bypassing the check and allowing the liquidation to proceed without reverting. This creates a scenario where the system does not verify whether the two borrowings (liquidator's and violator's) are of the same type, leading to an unintended mixture of stable and variable borrowings in a single loan account. Let's see how this is possible.

If we examine liquidation process, we can see that during ```transferBorrowFromViolator``` of ```UserLoanLogic``` there is a way for the ```borrow.amount``` to be zeroed out while the ```borrow.balance``` to be non-zero and, therefore, has active borrow debt. We can this here :
```solidity
function transferBorrowFromViolator(
        LoanManagerState.UserLoan storage loan,
        uint8 poolId,
        uint256 repayBorrowAmount
    ) external returns (uint256 repaidBorrowAmount, uint256 repaidBorrowBalance, uint256 loanStableRate) {
        LoanManagerState.UserLoanBorrow storage loanBorrow = loan.borrows[poolId];

        // violator loanBorrow has beed updated in prepareLiquidation

        repaidBorrowBalance = repayBorrowAmount;
@>        repaidBorrowAmount = Math.min(repaidBorrowBalance, loanBorrow.amount);
        loanStableRate = loanBorrow.stableInterestRate;

@>        loanBorrow.amount -= repaidBorrowAmount;
        loanBorrow.balance -= repaidBorrowBalance;

        if (loanBorrow.balance == 0) clearBorrow(loan, poolId);
    }
```
This is not hard to be accomplished by a user who can just borrow slightly more than his collateral, effectively making himself near under-collateralized and then immediately liquidate himself by the max amount he is able to and zero out the ```borrow.amount``` letting his ```borrow.balance``` to be > 0.

This exploit is particularly effective when there is a significant difference between the ```amount``` and ```balance```, indicating substantial accrued interest.

Users can then liquidate their own loans and those of others to mix and match borrowing types to their advantage. This could happen either intentionally or through someone else liquidating them, allowing them to exploit the system further.

For detailed transaction flows, refer to the Proof of Concept (PoC).

## Impact Details
The impact of this vulnerability is significant. If exploited on a large scale, it could severely disrupt the accounting within the protocol's ```HubPool``` for both stable and variable borrowings. This opens the door for malicious actors to take advantage of different interest rates and indexes, enabling them to manipulate their borrowings in a way that is highly beneficial to them but detrimental to the protocol. This could undermine the financial stability of the platform and violate the intended logic of the system.

## Proof of concept
## Proof of Concept
To demonstrate this vulnerability, the following test can be added under the ```"Liquidate"``` section in ```LoanManager.test.ts``` and run using ```npm test```. The comments in the code are crucial for understanding the logic and transaction flow:

        // Before the liquidation, the previous violator which will now be liquidator has to deposit some ETH.

        //  Now let's make the new violator's loan to be liquidatable by the previous violator and in this way the borrowing of previous violator in USDC will be mixed up with stable and variable borrowings.

        // Eventually, previous violators UserLoanBorrow for USDC will have amount and balance gained from both stable and variable borrowings and in this way the protocols accountings can be gamed. Also, it will have stableInterestRate of the new violator.

        // TLDR: A user was borrowed USDC variable but after his liquidation, he was able to liquidate another user and gain his stable USDC borrowings and in this way his borrowings was from mixed sources. The accountings of protocol were gamed, at the end.
    });
```
This test demonstrates how a user can exploit the system to mix stable and variable borrowings, thereby compromising the protocol.
