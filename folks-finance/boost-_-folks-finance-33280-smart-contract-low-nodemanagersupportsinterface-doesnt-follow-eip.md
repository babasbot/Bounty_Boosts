# `NodeManager.supportsInterface()` doesn't follow EIP-165

Report ID: #33280

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Low

Target: https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xA758c321DF6Cd949A8E074B22362a4366DB1b725

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value
- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)

## Description
## Brief/Intro
The `NodeManager` contract incorrectly implements the `supportsInterface` function, which fails to comply with the EIP-165 standard. As a result, it incorrectly returns `false` for the EIP-165 interface ID `0x01ffc9a7`. This could lead to compatibility issues with other contracts and systems that rely on correct EIP-165 interface support.

## Vulnerability Details:
The `NodeManager` contract implements the `INodeManager` interface, which extends `IERC165`, and is therefore expected to comply with EIP-165. According to EIP-165, the `supportsInterface` function should return:

- `true` for the `0x01ffc9a7` (EIP-165 interface ID)
- `false` for the `0xffffffff`
- `true` for any other `interfaceID` this contract implements
- `false` for any other `interfaceID`

However, `NodeManager.supportsInterface()` currently returns `false` for `0x01ffc9a7`, which is incorrect.

The relevant code snippet from `NodeManager` is:
```solidity
/// @notice Checks if the contract supports an interface.
/// @param interfaceId The ID of the interface to check.
/// @return A boolean indicating whether the contract supports the interface.
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external pure override returns (bool) {
    return interfaceId == type(INodeManager).interfaceId;
}
```

## Impact Details
The incorrect implementation of `supportsInterface` can lead to major compatibility issues. Contracts and systems that check for EIP-165 compliance may fail to interact with `NodeManager` correctly. This could cause failures in contract interactions, integrations, and potentially lead to the malfunction of decentralized applications relying on `NodeManager`.

## Recommendation:
Update the `supportsInterface` function as follows:
```diff
/// @notice Checks if the contract supports an interface.
/// @param interfaceId The ID of the interface to check.
/// @return A boolean indicating whether the contract supports the interface.
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external pure override returns (bool) {
-    return interfaceId == type(INodeManager).interfaceId;
+    return interfaceId == this.supportsInterface.selector;
}
```

## Proof of concept
## Proof of Concept

Add the following code to the test file `test/oracle/modules/NodeManager.test.ts`:
```javascript
describe("Chista0x-NodeManager", () => {
  it("Should successfully supportInterface with 0x01ffc9a7", async () => {
    const state = await nodeManager.supportsInterface("0x01ffc9a7");
    expect(state).to.be.equal(true);
  });

  it("Should successfully supportInterface with 0xffffffff", async () => {
    const state = await nodeManager.supportsInterface("0xffffffff");
    expect(state).to.be.equal(false);
  });

  it("Should successfully supportInterface with 0x12345678", async () => {
    const state = await nodeManager.supportsInterface("0x12345678");
    expect(state).to.be.equal(false);
  });  
});
```

Run the test with the command `npx hardhat test --grep "Chista0x-NodeManager"`

Test output:
```
  NodeManager
    Chista0x-NodeManager
      1) Should successfully supportInterface with 0x01ffc9a7
      ✔ Should successfully supportInterface with 0xffffffff

  2 passing (3s)
  1 failing
