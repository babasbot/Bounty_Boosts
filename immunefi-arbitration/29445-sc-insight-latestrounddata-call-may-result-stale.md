# `latestRoundData()` Call May Result Stale

Report ID: #29445

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://github.com/immunefi-team/vaults/blob/main/src/oracles/FeedRegistryL2.sol

Impacts:
- Stale Data Can Be Used

## Description
## Brief/Intro
Data returned from chainlink might be old.

## Vulnerability Details
The contract calls out to a Chainlink oracle receiving the latestRoundData(). If there is a problem with Chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. Chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale or incorrect data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).Take a look at the [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/historical-data#getrounddata-return-values)


## Impact Details
The latestRoundData() could return stale price data for the underlying asset.

## Recommendation
Implement comprehensive checks to validate the freshness of the data returned by Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` in your smart contracts. This includes verifying the timestamp of the latest round against a permissible time window to ensure the data's relevance and accuracy. Additionally, consider using Chainlink's `getRoundData()` function with specific round IDs for historical data checks and to verify data continuity. Add the following checks:
```solidity
...
( roundId, rawPrice, , updateTime, answeredInRound ) = AggregatorV3Interface(XXXXX).latestRoundData();
require(rawPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
...
```
