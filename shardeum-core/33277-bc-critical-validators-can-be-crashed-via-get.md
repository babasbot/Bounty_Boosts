Report ID: #33277

Report type: Blockchain/DLT

Report severity: Critical

Target: https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum/tree/dev

Impacts:
- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)

## Description
## Brief/Intro

Simply calling the default endpoint `eth_getBlockByHash` **with no params** causes a node to crash and die permanently.

By looping this over the network, an attacker can halt all transactions.



## Proof of Concept

- Run a local cluster:
    - `$ shardus start 10`

- Pick a node, say, 9001.

- Crash the node by navigating to `http://localhost:9001/eth_getBlockByHash` and not providing parameters

- Go to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/nodelist` and observe that the node is offline
