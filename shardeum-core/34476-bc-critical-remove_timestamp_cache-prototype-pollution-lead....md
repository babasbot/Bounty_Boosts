# remove_timestamp_cache prototype pollution leading crashed node

Submitted on Aug 13th 2024 at 18:17:14 UTC by @ZhouWu for [Boost | Shardeum: Core](https://immunefi.com/bounty/shardeum-core-boost/)

Report ID: #34476

Report type: Blockchain/DLT

Report severity: Critical

Target: https://github.com/shardeum/shardus-core/tree/dev

Impacts:
- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)

## Description
## Description
In the @shardus/core source code repo, node store a cache of transaction timstamp. Other node will ask the cache, if it's a miss the node will create new tx timestamp cache object derived from payload of the request. Subsequently there's another endpoint named remove_timestamp_cache , presumebly to remove these cache. This endpoint is referencing properties in object injection from the element in the payload from the request. Which make it vulnearble to prototype pollution


## Vulnerability
This happen due to referencing the object properties from the payload of the request directly when trying to remove the cache in `remove_timestamp_cache` endpoint. The code is as follows

```
if (this.txTimestampCache[cycleCounter] && this.txTimestampCache[cycleCounter][txId]) {
```
This way of referencing the cache object to assigned value is dangerous, because the referenced element come straight from the request payload. Consider the following payload
```
{
  cycleMarker: "rndmStr",
  cycleCounter: "__proto__",
  txId: "hasOwnProperty"
}
```

This mean that the cache object will be referenced in the following way
```
this.txTimestampCache["__proto__"]["hasOwnProperty"]
```
Essentially overwriting the prototype of the cache object, and the `hasOwnProperty` method of the cache object. This is problematic because `hasOwnProperty` is polluted to be a literal string which in turns break the code of the victim when object iteration or objection check operations are done later down the stream.





## Proof of Concept
- Launch a network of legit nodes.
- Launch an attacker node with this patch applied to shardus/core
- Wait for the attacker node to go active

 ```
 - Send a request to the attacker node with the victim node pubkey as a query parameter
 - `GET http://localhost:1337/launch-attk?victim=<publickey>`
 - observe the logs, the node exit unCleanly, essentially killing the node.

 ## Impact
 This is pretty straightforward single node attack, the script can be modified to attack the whole network to kill the whole network.
