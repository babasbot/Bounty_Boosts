Report ID: #26066

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf2991507952d9594e71a44a54fb19f3109d213a5#code

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Bug Description
In the TimeLock contract when queueing a new transaction, the `eta` parameter is not checked to be less than the maximum delay time constant. This allows the `eta` to be set further than 365 days in the future.

This is not a problem in itself, however it negates having a maximum delay constant value of 365 days as the `eta` can be any value greater than the current timestamp plus the delay value. This could cause a delay in upgrades as it may not be immediately obvious/caught that the `eta` is too far in the future. The transaction can always be cancelled but may cause lost time for the upgrade.

The current code is below:
https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/contracts/thirdparty/timelock/Timelock.sol#L63-L72
```
    function queueTransaction(address target, uint value, string memory signature, bytes memory data, uint eta) public returns (bytes32) {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Timelock::queueTransaction: Call must come from admin.");
        require(eta >= getBlockTimestamp().add(delay), "Timelock::queueTransaction: Estimated execution block must satisfy delay.");

        bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta));
        queuedTransactions[txHash] = true;

        emit QueueTransaction(txHash, target, value, signature, data, eta);
        return txHash;
    }

```


## Impact
Thus could lead to an unforeseen delay in the upgrade process.
## Risk Breakdown
Difficulty to Exploit: Easy

## Recommendation
It can be considered to let the contract set the ETA as the value of `block.timestamp` plus the delay.
This approach would allow for more predictable upgrade schedules.
```
    function queueTransaction(address target, uint value, string memory signature, bytes memory data,uint) public returns (bytes32) {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Timelock::queueTransaction: Call must come from admin.");
        uint256 eta = block.timestamp.add(delay);

        // this check below can then be removed so i ahve commented it out
        //require(eta >= getBlockTimestamp().add(delay), "Timelock::queueTransaction: Estimated execution block must satisfy delay.");

        bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta));
        queuedTransactions[txHash] = true;

        emit QueueTransaction(txHash, target, value, signature, data, eta);
        return txHash;
    }
```

## Proof of concept
## PoC
Please copy/paste the code below into a file in the test directory of a foundry project called `TansactionQueueTest.t.sol`

Please run the test with a fork of the mainnet
`forge test --fork-url {YOU_RPC_PROVIDER} --match-test test_queueTransaction -vv`

I also had to add this line below to the foundry.toml file
`evm_version = "shanghai"`
