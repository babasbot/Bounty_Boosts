# A malicious user can DoS force withdraw request for any legitimate user

Submitted on Nov 20th 2023 at 22:59:01 UTC by @CanYeRest298751 for [Boost | DeGate](https://immunefi.com/bounty/boosteddegatebugbounty/)

Report ID: #25892

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9C07A72177c5A05410cA338823e790876E79D73B#code

Impacts:
- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)

## Description
## Bug Description
A malicious user can request a `forceWithdraw` request on behalf of another `accountID`. This is correctly handled by the prover, and the request will be invalidated when processed by the operator. However in the meantime, the user with the account `accountID` cannot request a forceWithdraw, since only one `forceWithdraw` can be requested at a time.

## Impact
A malicious user can prevent a legitimate one to request `forceWithdraw` for her funds. Thereby denying the access to funds if operator is also malicious.
This can be used to keep big accounts inside the platform, and is a big centralization risk 

## Risk Breakdown
Difficulty to Exploit: Easy
Weakness:
CVSS2 Score:

## Recommendation
Also include the `from` variable in the mapping to check if forceWithdraw has been requested, since `from` can be invalid at request time.
