# `txHash` collision is possible

Submitted on Nov 29th 2023 at 18:23:56 UTC by @Madalad for [Boost | DeGate](https://immunefi.com/bounty/boosteddegatebugbounty/)

Report ID: #26259

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf2991507952d9594e71a44a54fb19f3109d213a5#code

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Bug Description
If the admin wishes to make the same call more than once with the same eta, this is impossible due to the fact they would share the same `txHash`. The admin would have to queue the transaction, wait at least 45 days, execute it, then queue it again and wait a further 45 days.

## Impact
Queueing two similar transactions causes the first to be overwritten, potentially deceiving the admin and/or users.

## Risk Breakdown
Difficulty to Exploit: Easy
Weakness:
CVSS2 Score:

## Recommendation
While it is possible to workaround this issue fairly simply, e.g. altering the `eta` to differ by one second, implementing some form of nonce in the hash calculation is conventional and provides the least amount of confusion/inconvenience.
