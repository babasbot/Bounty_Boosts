# Multisig Contract onChain can be bricked

Submitted on Dec 4th 2023 at 12:26:36 UTC by @copperscrewer for [Boost | DeGate](https://immunefi.com/bounty/boosteddegatebugbounty/)

Report ID: #26520

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2028834B2c0A36A918c10937EeA71BE4f932da52#code

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Bug Description
The Multisig contract, on a series of actions can be bricked. As it cannot execute anymore actions and fails to satisfy an Invariant ( length of owners is equal or greater than required signatures)

## Impact
Multisig cannot execute any transaction, cannot add, remove Owners as the contract becomes unusable

## Risk Breakdown
Difficulty to Exploit: Easy
Weakness:
CVSS2 Score:6.9

## Recommendation
Add a notNull modifier to replaceOwner



## Proof of concept
steps to reproduce
As we are testing the Gnosis Multisig, that works independently to the L2 contracts, we can test just this contract while replicating the Owners and required state.

Create an empty folder.

npx hardhat init


To create a project with directories like contracts, test

copy paste contract code from https://etherscan.io/address/0x2028834B2c0A36A918c10937EeA71BE4f932da52?utm_source=immunefi#code

to gnosis.sol in contracts folder

change compiler version or directly paste this in module exports in hardhat config.js This is done since the Gnosis multisig contract uses an old version of solidity  solidity: { compilers: [ { version: "0.4.22", }, { version: "0.8.19", settings: {}, }, ], },

paste following test script in test folder and run 
npx hardhat test test/gnosis.js\

```
const {ethers} = require("hardhat")
const {expect, assert} = require("chai")

var gnosis

let owners, deployer

describe("ReplaceOwner bug", function()

    before(async function(){

        owners = (await ethers.getSigners()).slice(0,6)
