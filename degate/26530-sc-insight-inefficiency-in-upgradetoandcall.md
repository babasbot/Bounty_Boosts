Submitted on Dec 4th 2023 at 14:53:54 UTC by @whunter for [Boost | DeGate](https://immunefi.com/bounty/boosteddegatebugbounty/)

Report ID: #26530

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9C07A72177c5A05410cA338823e790876E79D73B#code

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Bug Description
```
  function upgradeTo(address implementation) public onlyProxyOwner {
    _upgradeTo(implementation);
  }

  function upgradeToAndCall(address implementation, bytes memory data) payable public onlyProxyOwner {
    upgradeTo(implementation);
    (bool success, ) = address(this).call{value: msg.value}(data);
    require(success);
  }
```
In `upgradeToAndCall`, after calling `upgradeTo`, it calls itself. `msg.sender` will be the proxy address there.
It would be better to call implementation directly because the proxy itself has only privileged functions and it's unlikely that proxyOwner is proxy itself.


## Impact
Inefficiency in upgradeToAndCall.
Potential reputation damage to the protocol due to unoptimized code.

## Risk Breakdown
Difficulty to Exploit: Easy
Weakness:
CVSS2 Score:

## Recommendation
Call (delegate) the implementation directly.
