## Description
## Bug Description

We can see below are the **two separate transactions** that are initiated after `DepositProxy` contract deployment.
1. [upgradeTo](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1e5bc43a9a516618be17e0075ca12b7420b5daa42e377af2906a2c8d9619bdc)
2. [initialize](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd263c3c19fedb4a8765b8facd6bce1d1609b940d415d460351b590edba371970)

As can be seen on-chain, there are two separate tx : 1) for upgrading `implementation` address of the proxy and 2) for initializing that `implementation` contract from proxy with an `exchange` address.

Due to the protocol is using proxy/implementation pattern for upgradeability support, there is always a need to have an `initialize()` in implementation contract and it needs to be called in the context of proxy to initialize implementation contract.

This is the definition of `initialize()`:
```solidity
function initialize(
    address _exchange
    )
    external
{
    require(
        exchange == address(0) && _exchange != address(0),
        "INVALID_EXCHANGE"
    );
    owner = msg.sender;
    exchange = _exchange;
}
```

To initialize `DepositProxy's` implementation contract, there is a `initialize(address _exchange)` which takes an address of exchange. However, as we can see, this `initialize()` can be frontrun and attacker can initialize `exchange` with an attacker controlled address.

Once attacker frontrun and set an `exchange` to an attacker controlled address, he/she can bypass the check - `onlyExchange` defined on `withdraw()` from proxy's implementation and can steal all funds stored inside `DepositProxy`.

```solidity
function withdraw(
    address /*from*/,
    address to,
    address token,
    uint    amount
    )
    external
    override
    payable
    onlyExchange
    ifNotZero(amount)
{
    if (isETHInternal(token)) {
        to.sendETHAndVerify(amount, gasleft());
    } else {
        // Try to transfer the amount requested.
        // If this fails try to transfer the remaining balance in this contract.
        // This is to guard against non-standard token behavior where total supply
        // has changed in unexpected ways.
        if (!token.safeTransfer(to, amount)){
            uint amountPaid = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            require(amountPaid < amount, "UNEXPECTED");
            token.safeTransferAndVerify(to, amountPaid);
        }
    }
}

modifier onlyExchange()
{
    require(msg.sender == exchange, "UNAUTHORIZED");
    _;
}
```

For the future upgrades, proxy contract will remain same but implementation contract will be changing. Hence, proxy will need to upgrade and initialize again with new implementation address. 

Since Proxy's storage will not be changing, so the token's balances. As we can see, if such future upgrades happened with two separate tx - `upgradeTo` tx and `initialize` tx. Attacker can frontrun `initialize` tx OR backrun `upgradeTo` tx to initialize proxy's implementation with an attacker controlled address and then can easily steal all the funds that are already there in proxy contract.

## Impact

All the funds from the DepositProxy contracts can be stolen by frontrunning `initialize()` transaction of the proxy's implementation and transferring all the funds from proxy contract to attacker controlled address.
## Risk Breakdown

Difficulty to Exploit: Very Easy
## Recommendation

I recommend to initialize proxy's implementation at the time of upgrade using only `upgradeToAndCall()` instead of having two tx - 1) `upgradeTo()` and then 2) `initialize()`.

```solidity
upgradeToAndCall(address implementation, bytes memory data)
```

We should upgrade and initialize proxy contract by passing `implementation` address and `data` as `abi.encodeWithSignature("initialize(address)", exchange_address)` to `upgradeToAndCall()`.

## Proof Of Concept

**NOTE:** 
- For simplicity of POC, i am doing a prank on `proxy owner` for upgradeTo transaction. 

**Steps to Run using Foundry:**
- Install Foundry (https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- Open terminal and run `forge init poc` and `cd poc`
- Download implementation contract source using command `cast etherscan-source -d src --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY 0x8CCc06C4C3B2b06616EeE1B62F558f5b9C08f973`
- Modify `initialize()` from `DefaultDepositContract.sol` for showing an upgrade as **new implementation** as shown below (removed check `exchange == address(0)` as exchange was set in previous `initialize()`, so it cant be zero anymore).
```solidity
function initialize(
    address _exchange
    )
    external
{
    require(
        _exchange != address(0),
        "INVALID_EXCHANGE"
    );
    owner = msg.sender;
    exchange = _exchange;
}
```
- Paste following foundry code in TestPoC.t.sol
- Run using `forge test -vv`
