Report ID: #25906

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf2991507952d9594e71a44a54fb19f3109d213a5#code

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Bug Description
While using the `setDelay()` function,it's supposed to revert when the delay doesn't exceed the MINIMUM_DELAY.
But due to wrong validation logic, the delay can be set to exactly MINIMUM_DELAY.
In `setDelay()` function,it's making sure that `delay_ >= MINIMUM_DELAY`(delay is greater or equals minimum delay)
```
        require(delay_ >= MINIMUM_DELAY, "Timelock::setDelay: Delay must exceed minimum delay.");
```
where as it should have been `delay_ > MINIMUM_DELAY` to make sure that Delay is exceeding minimum delay.
## Impact
Intended behaviour of the smart contract and actual functionality doesn't match
## Risk Breakdown
Difficulty to Exploit: Easy
Weakness: N/A
CVSS2 Score: N/A

## Recommendation
change the require statement at line 226 
https://etherscan.io/address/0xf2991507952d9594e71a44a54fb19f3109d213a5#code#F1#L226
from 
```
        require(delay_ >= MINIMUM_DELAY, "Timelock::setDelay: Delay must exceed minimum delay.");
```
to 
```
        require(delay_ > MINIMUM_DELAY, "Timelock::setDelay: Delay must exceed minimum delay.");
```

```
    function setDelay(uint delay_) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(this), "Timelock::setDelay: Call must come from Timelock.");
        require(delay_ >= MINIMUM_DELAY, "Timelock::setDelay: Delay must exceed minimum delay.");
        require(delay_ <= MAXIMUM_DELAY, "Timelock::setDelay: Delay must not exceed maximum delay.");
        delay = delay_;

        emit NewDelay(delay);
    }
```

## Proof of concept
To demonstrate the issue,here the `setDelay()` function is called with the exact Minimum Delay(45 days,which is 3888000 seconds),and it is not reverting even though the delay isn't exceeding minimum delay
