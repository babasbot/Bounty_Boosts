# Possible emission of wrong data in `cancelTransaction()` 

Submitted on Dec 4th 2023 at 14:22:36 UTC by @Obin for [Boost | DeGate](https://immunefi.com/bounty/boosteddegatebugbounty/)

Report ID: #26527

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf2991507952d9594e71a44a54fb19f3109d213a5#code

Impacts:
- Contract can wrongly emit cancellation of not-previously-queued Tx

## Description
## Bug Description
The `cancelTransaction()` only sets the hash of the inputs to false. this implementation is sub-optimal and buggy as contract doesn't check if inputed data is correct. 

## Impact
In situation of input error, this will lead to:
1. Not actually deleting Tx as intended
2. Wrongly publishing / emitting a false data to have been cancelled. 

## Recommendation
```diff
function cancelTransaction(address target, uint value, string memory signature, bytes memory data, uint eta) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Timelock::cancelTransaction: Call must come from admin.");

        bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta));
+       require(queuedTransactions[txHash], "Timelock::cancelTransaction:Incorrect input or not queued");
        queuedTransactions[txHash] = false;

        emit CancelTransaction(txHash, target, value, signature, data, eta);
    }

```
