# Gnosis Multisig Contract can become unusable

Submitted on Dec 4th 2023 at 11:54:01 UTC by @copperscrewer for [Boost | DeGate](https://immunefi.com/bounty/boosteddegatebugbounty/)

Report ID: #26516

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2028834B2c0A36A918c10937EeA71BE4f932da52#code

Impacts:
- Multisig Contract can rendered unusable

## Description
## Bug Description
Gnosis multisig, has 6 owners and 4 required signatures
In the event of removing two owners, There would be 4 owners and 4 required signatures.
If replaceOwner was done with the zero address,
The required signatures will stay to be 4 while an Owner becomes
the 0 address leading to an unusable Gnosis multisig Contract

## Impact
Gnosis Multisig cannot execute any transaction, cannot add, remove Owners
as the contract becomes unusable

## Risk Breakdown
Difficulty to Exploit: Easy
Weakness: 
CVSS2 Score: Overall CVSS Score 6.9

## Recommendation
Add a notNull modifier to replaceOwner



## Proof of concept
steps to reproduce
------------------
As we are testing the Gnosis Multisig, that works independently to the L2 contracts, we can test just this contract while replicating the Owners and required state.

Create an empty folder.

`npx hardhat init`

To create a project with directories like contracts, test

copy paste contract code from
https://etherscan.io/address/0x2028834B2c0A36A918c10937EeA71BE4f932da52?utm_source=immunefi#code

to gnosis.sol in contracts folder


change compiler version or directly paste this in module exports in hardhat config.js
This is done since the Gnosis multisig contract uses an old version of solidity
`
  solidity: {
    compilers: [
      {
        version: "0.4.22",
      },
      {
        version: "0.8.19",
        settings: {},
      },
    ],
  },
`

paste following test script in test folder

```
const {ethers} = require("hardhat")
const {expect, assert} = require("chai")

var gnosis

let owners, deployer

describe("ReplaceOwner bug", function()
{
    before(async function(){

        owners = (await ethers.getSigners()).slice(0,6)
        deployer = owners[0]
        
    })

                4

            expect(await gnosis.required()).to.eq(4);
