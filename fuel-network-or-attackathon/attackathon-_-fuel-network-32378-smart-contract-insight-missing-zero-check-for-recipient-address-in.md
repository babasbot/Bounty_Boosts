# Missing Zero-Check for Recipient Address in withdraw Function

Submitted on Wed Jun 19 2024 19:03:37 GMT-0400 (Atlantic Standard Time) by @bugtester for [Attackathon | Fuel Network](https://immunefi.com/bounty/fuel-network-attackathon/)

Report ID: #32378

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge/tree/623dc288c332b9d55f59b1d3f5e04909e2b4435d/packages/fungible-token

Impacts:
- Permanent freezing of funds

## Description
## Brief/Intro
The withdraw function in the smart contract lacks a check to ensure that the recipient address (to parameter) is not a zero address (b256::zero()). This oversight can lead to potential loss of funds by sending tokens to an invalid address.
## Vulnerability Details
in the withdraw function, the recipient address parameter (to) is not validated to ensure it is not a zero address. Sending funds to a zero address is an invalid operation and could result in irreversible loss of tokens.

        let sender = msg_sender().unwrap();
        send_message(
            BRIDGED_TOKEN_GATEWAY,
            encode_data(to, amount.as_u256().as_b256(), l1_address, token_id),
            0,

        log(WithdrawalEvent {
            to: to,
            from: sender,
            amount: amount,
        });
    }

## fix 

    require(to != b256::zero(), BridgeFungibleTokenError::InvalidRecipient);


 #[payable]
  #[storage(read, write)]
 fn withdraw(to: b256) {
    // Check if the recipient address is zero
    require(to != b256::zero(), BridgeFungibleTokenError::InvalidRecipient);

    let amount: u64 = msg_amount();
    require(amount != 0, BridgeFungibleTokenError::NoCoinsSent);

    let asset_id = msg_asset_id();
    let sub_id = _asset_to_sub_id(asset_id);
    let token_id = _asset_to_token_id(asset_id);
    let l1_address = _asset_to_l1_address(asset_id);

    // Hexens Fuel1-4: Might benefit from a custom error message
    storage
        .tokens_minted
        .insert(
            asset_id,
            storage
                .tokens_minted
                .get(asset_id)
                .read() - amount,
        );
    burn(sub_id, amount);

    // send a message to unlock this amount on the base layer gateway contract
    let sender = msg_sender().unwrap();
    send_message(
        BRIDGED_TOKEN_GATEWAY,
        encode_data(to, amount.as_u256().as_b256(), l1_address, token_id),
        0,
    );
    log(WithdrawalEvent {
        to: to,
        from: sender,
        amount: amount,
    });
