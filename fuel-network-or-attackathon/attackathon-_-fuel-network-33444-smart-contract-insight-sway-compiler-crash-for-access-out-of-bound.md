## Description
## Brief/Intro

Sway compiler crash for access out-of-bound memory during arguments check in semantic analysis.

## Vulnerability Details
In `type_check_encode_append` function of the `semantic_analysis/ast_node/expression/intrinsic_function.rs#L239`, there's no length check for argument in [1]. When the intrinsic function is defined with improper argument parameters, out-of-bound access happens in [1]. 


```
fn type_check_encode_append(
    handler: &Handler,
    mut ctx: TypeCheckContext,
    kind: sway_ast::Intrinsic,
    arguments: &[Expression],
    _type_arguments: &[TypeArgument],
    span: Span,
) -> Result<(ty::TyIntrinsicFunctionKind, TypeId), ErrorEmitted> {
    let type_engine = ctx.engines.te();
    let engines = ctx.engines();

    let buffer_type = type_engine.insert(engines, encode_buffer_type(engines), None);
    let buffer_expr = {
        let ctx = ctx
            .by_ref()
            .with_help_text("")
            .with_type_annotation(buffer_type);
        ty::TyExpression::type_check(handler, ctx, &arguments[0])?
    };

    let item_span = arguments[1].span.clone(); // [1] no arguments length check before access. This leads to the out-of-bound vector access
```
## Impact Details
Online verification service or sway playground which accept sw contract could be crashed by the malicous sw contract.

## Proof of concept
## Proof of Concept

Compile the following contract using `forc build`:
```
library;

pub struct Buffer {
    buffer: u64
}

pub trait T {
    fn ar: (__e)
}

impl T for str[10] {
    fn a(self, buffer: Buffer) -> B {
        Buffer {
        buffer: __encode_buffer_append(buffer.buffer)
    }
}

```

Running it would get the following panic:
```
   Compiling library abi_superabis (/intrinstic_oob)
thread 'main' panicked at sway-core/src/semantic_analysis/ast_node/expression/intrinsic_function.rs:239:21:
index out of bounds: the len is 1 but the index is 1
