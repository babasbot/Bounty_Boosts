Report ID: #33407

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge/tree/e3e673e31f9e72d757d68979bb6796a0b7f9c8bc/packages/solidity-contracts

Impacts:
- Permanent freezing of funds

## Description
## Brief/Intro
The withdraw function in the smart contract lacks a check to ensure that the recipient address (to parameter) is not a zero addressThis oversight can lead to potential loss of funds by sending tokens to an invalid address.


## Vulnerability Details
in the withdraw function, the recipient address parameter (to) is not validated to ensure it is not a zero address. Sending funds to a zero address is an invalid operation and could result in irreversible loss of tokens.

 IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(to, amount);


    //emit event for successful token withdraw
    emit Withdrawal(bytes32(uint256(uint160(to))), tokenAddress, amount);
## Impact Details
loss of funds

        
## Proof of concept
## Proof of Concept

function finalizeWithdrawal(
    address to,
    address tokenAddress,
    uint256 l2BurntAmount,
    uint256 /*tokenId*/
) external payable virtual override whenNotPaused onlyFromPortal {
    if (l2BurntAmount == 0) {
        revert CannotWithdrawZero();
    }


    if (messageSender() != assetIssuerId) {
        revert InvalidSender();
    }


    uint8 decimals = _getTokenDecimals(tokenAddress);
    uint256 amount = _adjustWithdrawalDecimals(decimals, l2BurntAmount);


    //reduce deposit balance and transfer tokens (math will underflow if amount is larger than allowed)
    _deposits[tokenAddress] = _deposits[tokenAddress] - l2BurntAmount;
    IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(to, amount);


    //emit event for successful token withdraw
    emit Withdrawal(bytes32(uint256(uint160(to))), tokenAddress, amount);
}

### fix
Add check address check to param
