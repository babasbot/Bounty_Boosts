Report ID: #33303

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Medium

Target: https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-libs/tree/0f47d33d6e5da25f782fc117d4be15b7b12d291b

Impacts:
- Compiler bug

## Description
This is a compiler bug since resulting value 0 sign is changed to negative. This library are meant to be used by third party apps as mentioned by Fuel team in github page

## Brief/Intro
It seems that if you are adding same number with different sign then resulting 0 sign is changed which is not correct

## Vulnerability Details
1. If `add` is called using number 3 and -3 then result should be 0 with positive sign
2. But since 3>3 is false so condition move to else condition which changes the sign even though it was not required

```
if self.underlying > other.underlying {
                underlying = self.underlying - other.underlying;
            } else {
                underlying = other.underlying - self.underlying;
                non_negative = false;
            }
```

4. Ideally the condition should be `if self.underlying >= other.underlying `

## Impact Details
Result will be with incorrect sign

## Proof of Concept

```
script;

use sway_libs::fixed_point::ifp64::IFP64;
use std::assert::assert;

fn main() -> bool {
	let num = IFP64::from_uint(42_u32);
    let num2 = IFP64::from_uint(42_u32);
	
	let mut res = num + num2.sign_reverse();
	// fails since resulting 0 has -ve sign
	assert(res.non_negative());

    true
}
