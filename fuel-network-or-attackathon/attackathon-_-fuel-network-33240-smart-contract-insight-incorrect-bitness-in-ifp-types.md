- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
# Fuel Network bug report
## Incorrect Bitness in IFP Types
### Description
The bitness of the `IFP` types is incorrectly defined. Specifically:

`IFP64` is actually 33 bits.
`IFP128` is actually 65 bits.
`IFP256` is actually 129 bits.

## Root Cause
Examining the definition of `IFP64` as an example:
```rs
/// The 64-bit signed fixed point number type.
///
/// # Additional Information
///
/// Represented by an underlying `UFP32` number and a boolean.
pub struct IFP64 {
    /// The underlying value representing the `IFP64` type.
    underlying: UFP32,
    /// The underlying boolean representing a negative value for the `IFP64` type.
    non_negative: bool,
}
```
The `IFP64` type internally uses a `UFP32`, which occupies `32` bits, along with a single bit for the `non_negative` boolean.
This totals `33` bits, not `64` as the name suggests.

## Impact
The primary impact is the misleading and confusing naming of these types.
This issue is of low severity but can cause misunderstanding.

## Proposed fix
Correct the names of the IFP types to accurately reflect their bitness.

        
## Proof of concept
# Proof of Concept
Run the POC's with `forc test`

```rs
contract;

use sway_libs::fixed_point::ifp64::IFP64;

abi Tester { 
    fn wrong_bitness() -> bool;
}

impl Tester for Contract {
    fn wrong_bitness() -> bool {
        IFP64::bits() != 33
    }
}

#[test]
fn test() {
    let caller = abi(Tester, CONTRACT_ID);
    assert(caller.wrong_bitness() == true); // the bitness is wrong
}
```
