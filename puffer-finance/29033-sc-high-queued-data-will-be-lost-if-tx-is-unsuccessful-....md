Report ID: #29033

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: High

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0x3C28B7c7Ba1A1f55c9Ce66b263B33B204f2126eA#code

Impacts:
- Queued data will be lost if Tx is unsuccessful or unaffected as intended

## Description
## Brief/Intro
Timelock::executeTransaction() implementation is too optimistic given that it doesnt handle situations of:
1. Unsuccessful Call
2. Successful call but unaffected operations / returnValue (false)
In these scenarios the queued Tx data is lost and may require requeue and undesirable delay.

## Vulnerability Details
Depth 1:
In a situation where Timelock::executeTransaction() is unsuccessful, the transaction does not revert. instead it overwrites the queued tx. This is obviously an undesirable bug in implementation as OPERATOR at best will need to re-queue and be delayed.

NOTE: If this is the desired implementation, then contract is wrong to not emit call status as an argument as the emission makes the public wrongly assume it was a successful Tx. I doubt it is though.

First, its should be noted that the depth in impact of this bug does not end in appending `require(success, "Timelock: TX failed")` as data can still be lost even at that. Hence I'll explain the 2 depths and of course deeper Impact illustrated in POC.

Depth 2:
From a hacker perspective, the bool return value in a call is just a dummy and does not guarantee the desired effect on target contract. Lets not be fooled by that.
The problem here is akin to what Openzeppelin tries to solve by implementing SafeERC20 which provides a logic that unites various ERC20 of arbitrary addresses and return signatures.
A Tx or call can be successful (return the dummy true value) yet intended operation remains undesirable / unaffected at target contract. In this situation, will return `bool success == true;` and queued data `queue[txHash]` will still be lost.

This scenario is actually very realistic and possible given that these calls are to arbitrary addresses whose implementations and return signatures are of arbitrary patterns. 

## Impact Details
Contract will lose queued data permanently. Forcing operator to requeue and delay before transacting.
Given that this is of high chance occurrence, its a High severity.
Note that the re-queued Tx will still be susceptible.
