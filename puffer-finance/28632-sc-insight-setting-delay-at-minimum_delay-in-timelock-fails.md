Report ID: #28632

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0x3C28B7c7Ba1A1f55c9Ce66b263B33B204f2126eA#code

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Introduction
Due to the use of `>=` instead of `>`, setting the delay exactly at the `MINIMUM_DELAY` will fail.

## Vulnerability Details
When setting a delay for the timelock, there is a `MINIMUM_DELAY` set for the timelock.
```solidity
     * @notice Minimum delay enforced by the contract
     */
    uint256 public constant MINIMUM_DELAY = 7 days;
```
However when checking for this delay, `>=` is used instead of `>`.
```solidity
    function _setDelay(uint256 newDelay) internal {
        if (newDelay <= MINIMUM_DELAY) {
            revert InvalidDelay(newDelay);
        }
        emit DelayChanged(delay, newDelay);
        delay = newDelay;
    }
```
Therefore setting the delay at exactly `MINIMUM_DELAY` will cause the `newDelay <= MINIMUM_DELAY` check to be true and therefore the `setDelay` transaction to revert.

## Impact Details

This can be surprising to users such as the operations multisig, that waited to execute their `setDelay` transaction but their transaction will unexpectedly fail because of the above behaviour.

## Proof of Concept
Add this to the `test/unit/Timelock.t.sol` test found in https://github.com/PufferFinance/pufETH

```solidity
function test_updating_to_minimum_delay_reverts() public {
        vm.startPrank(timelock.COMMUNITY_MULTISIG());

        // set exactly at minimum delay
        bytes memory minimumDelayCallData = abi.encodeCall(Timelock.setDelay, (7 days));

        uint256 operationId = 1234;

        // update to minimum delay
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) =
            timelock.executeTransaction(address(timelock), minimumDelayCallData, operationId);

        // confirm the transaction failed
        assertEq(success, false);

        // confirm the delay is not set at minimum delay of 7 days
        assertTrue(timelock.delay() != 7 days, "not equal minimum delay");
    }
```
