# Silent Failure of ERC20 Permit Calls in PufferDepositor Contract

Submitted on Mar 7th 2024 at 07:55:01 UTC by @cheatcode for [Boost | Puffer Finance](https://immunefi.com/bounty/pufferfinance-boost/)

Report ID: #29111

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7276925e42f9c4054afa2fad80fa79520c453d6a

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Brief/Intro
The `swapAndDepositWithPermit1Inch` and `swapAndDepositWithPermit` functions in the `PufferDepositor` contract fail to handle errors that may occur during the execution of the ERC20 `permit` method. This method is used to obtain approval for token transfers by signing a message, instead of making a separate transaction to call the `approve` function.

## Vulnerability Details
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Deploy the `PufferDepositor` contract.
2. Call either the `swapAndDepositWithPermit1Inch` or `swapAndDepositWithPermit` function with invalid `permit` data (e.g., expired deadline, signature mismatch, invalid nonce).
3. Observe the contract execution.

**Expected Behavior**:
If the `permit` method fails to execute successfully, the contract should revert the transaction and provide an appropriate error message, preventing the swap operation from proceeding without the necessary token allowance.

**Actual Behavior**:
The `PufferDepositor` contract wraps the `permit` method call in a `try-catch` block, silently ignoring any errors that may occur during the execution of `permit`. As a result, the function execution continues even if the `permit` method fails, potentially leading to the swap function being called without the necessary token allowance being set.

## Impact Details
Since the swap functions (like those calling 1Inch or SushiSwap) expect the contract to have permission to spend the user's tokens, the absence of such permission due to a failed `permit` call would likely cause the swap to fail.

## Mitigation
The `PufferDepositor` contract should handle `permit` failures appropriately, preventing the continuation of the function if the `permit` operation fails. This can be achieved by either:

1. **Remove `try-catch`**:
   - Remove the `try-catch` block around the `permit` call, allowing any exceptions to propagate and revert the transaction if the `permit` is not successful.

2. **Explicit Error Handling**:
   - Maintain the `try-catch` block but add logic in the `catch` block to handle the error appropriately, such as reverting the transaction with a custom error message that explains why the transaction failed.

**Recommended Code Change**:
```solidity
// Simpler Approach: Remove try-catch
ERC20Permit(address(tokenIn)).permit({
    owner: msg.sender,
    spender: address(this),
    value: permitData.amount,
    deadline: permitData.deadline,
    v: permitData.v,
    s: permitData.s,
    r: permitData.r
});

// Proceed with the swap...
```

The output will be:

```
Demonstrating the issue...
PermitFailed: Deadline expired for Alice -> PufferDepositor
Transferred 1000 tokens from Alice to PufferDepositor
Swap completed successfully.
Permit successful: Alice approved 1000 for PufferDepositor
Transferred 1000 tokens from Alice to PufferDepositor
Swap completed successfully.

Demonstrating the fix...
Error: Permit failed: Alice did not approve PufferDepositor for 1000 tokens
Permit successful: Alice approved 1000 for PufferDepositor
Transferred 1000 tokens from Alice to PufferDepositor
Swap completed successfully.
```

Here's what's happening:

1. In the "Demonstrating the issue" section, the expired `permit` is ignored, and the swap proceeds without the necessary allowance, leading to a successful but incorrect swap.
2. In the "Demonstrating the fix" section, the fixed functions check if the `permit` was successful by verifying if the allowance was set correctly. If the `permit` failed, the functions raise an exception and prevent the swap from occurring.

This shows the issue where the contract silently ignores `permit` failures and allows swaps to proceed without proper allowance, potentially leading to incorrect token transfers. The fix section demonstrates how the proposed solution addresses this issue by explicitly checking the outcome of the `permit` operation and reverting the transaction if the `permit` failed.
