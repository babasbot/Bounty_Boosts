# `pufETH/src/Timelock::_setDelay()` - L256: State constant `MINIMUM_DELAY` is incorrectly treated as an invalid minimum delay value, as can be seen here where `newDelay <= MINIMUM_DELAY` is used instead of `newDelay < MINIMUM_DELAY`.

Report ID: #28660

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://etherscan.io/address/0x3C28B7c7Ba1A1f55c9Ce66b263B33B204f2126eA#code

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Brief/Intro

# Summary:
- The hardcoded constant value for timelock minimum delay is *incorrectly* treated as an *invalid* timelock delay value.

# Impact in scope: 
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value
- In this context the promised "return" is related to the hardcoded minimum timelock delay value of `7 days`.

## Vulnerability Details

Buggy function:
```solidity
    function _setDelay(uint256 newDelay) internal {
        if (newDelay <= MINIMUM_DELAY) {
            revert InvalidDelay(newDelay);
        }
        emit DelayChanged(delay, newDelay);
        delay = newDelay;
    }
```
If for any reason it's not clear yet what the bug is, let me clarify for you:
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Minimum delay enforced by the contract
     */
    uint256 public constant MINIMUM_DELAY = 7 days;
```
It should be clear enough from the above that the value for `MINIMUM_DELAY` is a VALID minimum value for the timelock delay period.
Therefore the `<=` in `newDelay <= MINIMUM_DELAY` should be `<`, because a `newDelay` value of 7 days should be 100% valid, but anything LESS than 7 days is INVALID, therefore we should use `newDelay < MINIMUM_DELAY` instead, so that it translates to all values of `newDelay` where `newDelay >= MINIMUM_DELAY`, are all VALID values.

## Impact Details

- Can never change the timelock delay value to the hardcoded VALID minimum delay period of 7 days as is intended protocol functionality because the buggy function was called during constructor/deployment time, as well as called whenever they want to change the delay again after deployment.
- The lowest possible value(in days) for the timelock delay is 8 days, contrary to the "promised" minimum delay of 7 days.
- Investors/VCs, regulators, users, protocol DAO/governance, multisigs, external integrating projects and external devs will all expect the timelock's minimum possible delay to be 7 days(as promised by the hardcoded `MINIMUM_DELAY` constant), but this is not the case. Anyone who plans/strategizes or builds according to this expectation, will be disappointed to learn that a delay of 7 days is not possible.
- it seems there might have been some confusion during protocol tests and test setup and especially during deployment contract setup & testing as to "weird" behaviour when a minimum delay of 7 days was selected, so the response was to modify it to `7 days + 1` in order to bypass the "weird"/revert behaviour... when in fact it was simply the bug in the internal `_setDelay()` function.

# Recommendations:

- Ensure that the hardcoded value of constant `MINIMUM_DELAY` is treated correctly throughout the codebase. Here correctly means that `7 days` timelock delay is still a valid value to be used in the protocol and that only anything strictly less than `7 days` is invalid.
- Ensure that during tests setup & testing that assumptions are properly validated. It seems the intention here was to deploy with `7 days` as the initial timelock delay value, but your tests/deployment transactions reverted, due to this bug. The tests/deploy script was then modified to bypass this revert, by using a modified initial timelock delay value of `7 days + 1`. 
- Correct understanding of minimum & maximum boundaries in terms of valid vs invalid values is crucial, and the implementation of this correct understanding must be consistently applied throughout the codebase.

# BUGFIX:
```diff
    function _setDelay(uint256 newDelay) internal {
-       if (newDelay <= MINIMUM_DELAY) {
+       if (newDelay < MINIMUM_DELAY) {
            revert InvalidDelay(newDelay);
        }
        emit DelayChanged(delay, newDelay);
        delay = newDelay;
    }
```

## Proof of Concept

# TEST1:
https://github.com/PufferFinance/pufETH/blob/3a9f943b3a9133cb2ee9bbf8c39e876c4170ead7/script/DeployPuffETH.s.sol#L95
```solidity
initialDelay: 7 days
```
https://github.com/PufferFinance/pufETH/blob/3a9f943b3a9133cb2ee9bbf8c39e876c4170ead7/script/DeployPuffETH.s.sol#L190
```solidity
uint256 delayInSeconds = 7 days;
```
With the bug *not yet fixed*(`newDelay <= MINIMUM_DELAY`) and the protocol tests modified to use `7 days` instead of (`0` or `7 days + 1`) as per above code snippets, we get an `InvalidDelay` error/revert in the test results using forge command `ETH_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY forge test --contracts script/DeployPuffETH.s.sol -vvvvv`:
