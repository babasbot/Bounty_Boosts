# The function always revert if `_stakeNFT == True` due to a missing approval

Submitted on Mar 10th 2024 at 20:34:07 UTC by @stiglitz for [Boost | ZeroLend](https://immunefi.com/bounty/zerolend-boost/)

Report ID: #29213

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: High

Target: https://github.com/zerolend/governance

Impacts:
- Permanent freezing of funds
- Temporary freezing of funds for at least 1 hour

## Description
## Brief/Intro
See the function `safeTransferFrom::_createLock`:

```solidity
if (_stakeNFT) {
        _mint(address(this), _tokenId);
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(_to);
        safeTransferFrom(address(this), address(staking), _tokenId, data);
} else _mint(_to, _tokenId);
```
 if `_stakeNFT == True`, the tx always reverts because `msg.sender` is the user who called `createLock`, and the user does not have approval for moving NFT owned by someone else. As we can see in the code, the NFT is minted to `address(this)`, so the user is not the owner, and he needs approval from the contact. 

However, the problem imho is the fact that the NFT is not even owned by a user but by the contract itself. Because if approval is implemented to make the transfer succeed, the user has no ability to get what is his.

## Vulnerability Details
Let's also look at the `OmnichainStaking::onERC721Received`:

```solidity
if (msg.sender == address(lpLocker)) {
        lpPower[tokenId] = lpLocker.balanceOfNFT(tokenId);
        _mint(from, lpPower[tokenId] * 4);
}
```

And also the function `OmnichainStaking::unstakeLP`:

```solidity
function unstakeLP(uint256 tokenId) external { /
        _burn(msg.sender, lpPower[tokenId] * 4);
        lpLocker.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
}
```
Lets say we have the approval and we create a lock with `_stakeNFT  == True`. The function `safeTransferFrom` is executed where `from == address(this)` which is `BaseLocker` (`LockerLP`). NOT A USER.

Who is gonna call `unstakeLP` ? The tokens are owner by the `LockerLP` contract, and only the contract can unstake them. 

## Impact Details
The protocol does not work as it is supposed to, and if the function with `_stakeNFT  == True` is called and it works (it does not right now) - The user will basically lose his invested money into veNFT and the voting power will be useless owned by the protocol contract.

I think the impact is very high and I would say critical. But because of the missing approval, the function does not work at all, so the impact is not there :D

## Proof of Concept
### Ve mock token
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.6;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

// Example class - a mock class derived from ERC20
contract VeToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialBalance) ERC20("Ve Token", "VT") public {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialBalance);
    }
}
```
### Re mock token
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.6;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

// Example class - a mock class derived from ERC20
contract ReToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialBalance) ERC20("Re Token", "RT") public {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialBalance);
    }
}


```
### X contract (ERC721 compatible)
```solidity
import {ILocker} from "../contracts/interfaces/ILocker.sol";
import {OmnichainStaking} from "../contracts/locker/OmnichainStaking.sol";
import {PoolVoter} from "../contracts/voter/PoolVoter.sol";

contract X {
    ILocker public lpLocker;
    OmnichainStaking public staking;
    PoolVoter public poolVoter;

    constructor(address _lpLocker, address _staking, address _poolVoter){
        lpLocker  = ILocker(_lpLocker);
        staking   = OmnichainStaking(_staking);
        poolVoter = PoolVoter(_poolVoter);
    }

    function onERC721Received(
        address,
        address from,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4) {
        //lpLocker.safeTransferFrom(address(this), lpLocker, tokenId);

        return this.onERC721Received.selector;
    }

    // Unstake from omnichain staking
    function unstakeLP(uint256 tokenId) external { 
        staking.unstakeLP(tokenId);
    }
    // This allows me to send anywhere I want
    function send(address to, uint256 tokenId) external {
        lpLocker.safeTransferFrom(address(this), to, tokenId);
    }

    function vote(address[] calldata _poolVote,uint256[] calldata _weights) external {
        poolVoter.vote(_poolVote, _weights);
    }
}
```
### Y contract (ERC721 compatible)
```solidity
import {ILocker} from "../contracts/interfaces/ILocker.sol";
import {OmnichainStaking} from "../contracts/locker/OmnichainStaking.sol";
import {PoolVoter} from "../contracts/voter/PoolVoter.sol";

contract Y {
    ILocker public lpLocker;
    OmnichainStaking public staking;
    PoolVoter public poolVoter;

    constructor(address _lpLocker, address _staking, address _poolVoter){
        lpLocker  = ILocker(_lpLocker);
        staking   = OmnichainStaking(_staking);
        poolVoter = PoolVoter(_poolVoter);
    }

    function onERC721Received(
        address,
        address from,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4) {
        //lpLocker.safeTransferFrom(address(this), lpLocker, tokenId);

        return this.onERC721Received.selector;
    }

    // Unstake from omnichain staking
    function unstakeLP(uint256 tokenId) external { 
        staking.unstakeLP(tokenId);
    }
    // This allows me to send anywhere I want
    function send(address to, uint256 tokenId) external {
        lpLocker.safeTransferFrom(address(this), to, tokenId);
    }

    function vote(address[] calldata _poolVote,uint256[] calldata _weights) external {
        poolVoter.vote(_poolVote, _weights);
    }
}
```

### Failing test
```python
from wake.testing import *

from pytypes.openzeppelin.contracts.proxy.ERC1967.ERC1967Proxy import ERC1967Proxy
from pytypes.contracts.locker.OmnichainStaking import OmnichainStaking
from pytypes.contracts.locker.LockerToken import LockerToken
from pytypes.contracts.voter.PoolVoter import PoolVoter

'''
Test written in Wake testing framework (https://getwake.io/) aka boosted brownie

Docs: 
https://ackeeblockchain.com/wake/docs/latest/

Repo:
https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/wake

How to run this test:

Install wake
    $ pip install eth-wake

To have actual anvil version
    $ foundryup

After installing project dependencies initialize wake
It will create `tests` folder and process foundry remappings if any
    $ wake up

Generate python representation of contracts
    $ wake init pytypes

Go to wake `tests` folder and paste this code in tests/test_approval.py and run
    $ wake test tests/test_approval.py

If you are interest I would be happy to provide more examples + complete protocol deployment and fuzz testing
(yout tests are not good tbh)
