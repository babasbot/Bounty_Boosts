`ValidationLogic::validateBorrow()` - L227-L231: Incorrect implementation of the intended (AAVE) protocol logic prevents all users with a health factor (HF) equal to `HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD` from borrowing.

## Vulnerability Details

Description:

Users won't be able to borrow or borrow more whenever their health factor (HF) value is EQUAL to the `HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`. This is not a correct representation of intended protocol logic.
Intended protocol logic makes it possible for users to borrow/borrow more whenever their `HF >= HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`.

To add even more weight to my argument, see below where it's made clear that there are two different "minimum" HF liquidation thresholds, the absolute minimum allowed one, `0.95e18`, where immediate liquidation probably occurs for any HF value below it, and the other more healthy "minimum" HF liq threshold with a value of `1e18`:
```solidity
  // Minimum health factor allowed under any circumstance
  // A value of 0.95e18 results in 0.95
  uint256 public constant MINIMUM_HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD = 0.95e18;

  /**
   * @dev Minimum health factor to consider a user position healthy
   * A value of 1e18 results in 1
   */
  uint256 public constant HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD = 1e18;
```
There shouldn't exist any valid logical reason why `HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD = 1e18` should be excluded as a valid minimum value as is incorrectly done in the below code snippet:
```solidity
    require(
      vars.healthFactor > HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD,
      Errors.HEALTH_FACTOR_LOWER_THAN_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD
    );
```
Here it's clear that the `require` check will revert whenever `vars.healthFactor <= HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD` is true. The `<` is correct. It's the `=` in `<=` that's wrong, because the `HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD` is a VALID minimum (healthy) HF value, and to exclude it like the current implementation does, is in fact completely wrong.

Not only that, but check the error description: `Errors.HEALTH_FACTOR_LOWER_THAN_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`. It's clear what it says, but the code implementation doesn't reflect this.

## Impact Details

POTENTIAL IMPACT IN SCOPE:
- Griefing
  -- no attacker or attack necessary, instead it's the bug itself causing griefing to the user/borrower, unfairly preventing them from borrowing when they should be able to borrow.
  
In case this contract is not in scope, it affects the results of at least the following contracts & functions in scope, therefore primacy of impact applies:
`WrappedTokenGatewayV3::borrowETH()`
and
`Pool::flashLoan()`
for both zksync and manta.

IMPACTS:
- Users won't be able to borrow or borrow more whenever their health factor (HF) value is EQUAL to the `HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`.
- Some users who might check out your smart contracts will notice that your intended protocol logic should allow for borrowing in the case where `vars.healthFactor == HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`, but that the expected behaviour is different from the actual behaviour, where it doesn't allow this.
- Specifically, the following functions will revert when called under above conditions, for both zksync and manta:
  -- `WrappedTokenGatewayV3::borrowETH()`
  -- `Pool::flashLoan()`

## Proof of Concept

PoC:

For some reason I couldnt get the tests to work in your local github repos, so I decided to run the same tests in AAVE's github repo, which should suffice. 

And just for your records, here is the test error I get when I try run `npm run test` or `yarn test` in your repo:

# THE AAVE TESTS:
Command used for all tests: `npm run test`

# TESTS:
- Test 1: With bug not fixed
- Test 2: With bug fixed
- Test 3: Control test.

# Test 1: 
- With bug not fixed and explicitly passing in `vars.healthFactor = 1e18` via a slight modification in `GenericLogic::calculateUserAccountData()` - L172-L177:
```solidity
    vars.healthFactor = 1e18; /// @audit added for PoC/testing purposes
    // vars.healthFactor = (vars.totalDebtInBaseCurrency == 0)
    //   ? type(uint256).max
    //   : (vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency.percentMul(vars.avgLiquidationThreshold)).wadDiv(
    //     vars.totalDebtInBaseCurrency
    //   ); /// @audit NOTE: this is required for some of the protocol tests to execute successfully...
```
# Test 1 results:
```solidity
  AToken: Mint and Burn Event Accounting
    ✔ User 1 supplies DAI
    ✔ User 1 supplies DAI on behalf of user 2

    1) User 2 supplies ETH,and borrows DAI

```
In above test result with one failed test the reason string `35` is:
```solidity
string public constant HEALTH_FACTOR_LOWER_THAN_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD = '35'; // 'Health factor is lesser than the liquidation threshold'
```
I explicitly passed in a HF exactly equal to the constant `HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`, and the buggy require check saw this as an invalid HF.

The next test was run with the bug fixed and still explicitly passing in `vars.healthFactor = 1e18` as the borrower's HF.

# Test 2: with bug fixed
```solidity
    require(
      //vars.healthFactor > HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD,
      vars.healthFactor >= HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD, /// @audit added for PoC/testing purposes
      Errors.HEALTH_FACTOR_LOWER_THAN_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD
    );
```
# Test 2 results (see my two @audit tags below):
```solidity
  AToken: Mint and Burn Event Accounting
    ✔ User 1 supplies DAI
    ✔ User 1 supplies DAI on behalf of user 2
    ✔ User 2 supplies ETH,and borrows DAI 						/// @audit failed in test 1, passes here
    ✔ User 2 borrows more DAI - confirm mint event includes accrued interest
    ✔ User 1 - supplies more DAI - confirm mint event includes accrued interest
    ✔ User 1 supplies more DAI again - confirm mint event includes accrued interest
    ✔ User 2 repays all remaining DAI
    ✔ User 1 withdraws all deposited funds and interest
    ✔ User 2 borrows, pass time and repay DAI less than accrued debt
    ✔ User 1 withdraws amount less than accrued interest
    .

  AToken: Transfer
    ✔ User 0 deposits 1000 DAI, transfers 1000 to user 0
    ✔ User 0 deposits 1000 DAI, disable as collateral, transfers 1000 to user 1
    ✔ User 0 deposits 1000 DAI, transfers 5 to user 1 twice, then transfer 0 to user 1
    ✔ User 0 deposits 1000 DAI, transfers to user 1
    ✔ User 0 deposits 1 WETH and user 1 tries to borrow the WETH with the received DAI as collateral

    1) User 1 tries to transfer all the DAI used as collateral back to user 0 (revert expected) /// @audit this is OK, it's because of the code snippet I commented out so that I could pass in `vars.healthFactor = 1e18` explicitly. Uncomment this code snippet and this test will pass.
    .

  104 passing (27s)
  1 failing

  1) AToken: Transfer
       User 1 tries to transfer all the DAI used as collateral back to user 0 (revert expected):
     AssertionError: Expected transaction to be reverted with reason '35', but it didn't revert
      at Context.<anonymous> (test-suites/atoken-transfer.spec.ts:228:5)
```
Here the bugfixed worked, the user was able to borrow successfully >>> `✔ User 2 supplies ETH,and borrows DAI`.
Ignore the failed test, it's expected because I commented out the code snippet necessary for this failed test to pass...

# Test 3: Control test.
- using test command: `npm run test`
- Here I removed all my changes that I made to the codebase for testing purposes, but I left my bugfix in there, and ran all the tests again, to see if my bugfix causes any issues with any of your tests.
The bugfix again:
```solidity
    require(
      //vars.healthFactor > HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD,
      vars.healthFactor >= HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD, /// @audit added for PoC/testing purposes
      Errors.HEALTH_FACTOR_LOWER_THAN_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD
    );
```
# Test 3 test result:

NO issues, all AAVE tests ran successfully with my bugfix implemented, as expected.

# THE BUGFIX:

`ValidationLogic::validateBorrow()` - L227-L231:
