Report ID: #28910

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: High

Target: https://github.com/zerolend/governance

Impacts:
- Manipulation of governance voting result deviating from voted outcome and resulting in a direct change from intended effect of original results

## Description
## Brief/Intro
registerGauge function has a boolean value check written incorrectly, causing the pool to never be registered.

## Vulnerability Details
in the function registerGauge, the if bool check is wrong,
```
 mapping(address => bool) public isPool; // pool => bool


if (!isPool[_asset]) {
    _pools.push(_asset);
    isPool[_asset] = true;
}
```

```
// register the gauge in the factory
  const gauges = await factory.gauges(lending.erc20.target);
  await poolVoter.registerGauge(lending.erc20.target, gauges.splitterGauge);
```

## Impact Details
lead to pools will never be success registered

## Proof of concept
    function testEXP() public {

        address owner = 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266;
        deal(address(stake), address(owner), 1 ether);
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        poolVoter.registerGauge(address(1), address(11111));
        console.log(poolVoter.length());

        poolVoter.registerGauge(address(3), address(22222));
        console.log(poolVoter.length());

    }
