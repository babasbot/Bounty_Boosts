Report ID: #29019

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: High

Target: https://github.com/zerolend/governance

Impacts:
- Temporary freezing of funds for at least 1 hour

## Description
## Brief/Intro
The ZeroLendToken contract in the Governance module mishandles the whitelist. It is treated as a blacklist.

## Vulnerability Details
The code below handles updating of the balance when a token is sent by `from` to `to`. 
```
function _update(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 value
) internal virtual override {
    require(!blacklisted[from] && !blacklisted[to], "blacklisted");
    require(!paused && !whitelisted[from], "paused");
    super._update(from, to, value);
}
```

Note that if `whitelisted` is True, the token should allow the transfer. However the condition is flipped, so it will certainly abort the transfer.

## Impact Details
A whitelisted user will not be able to transfer their tokens, resulting in a temporary freezing of funds. 

## Recommended remidiation
Consider refactoring the code as suggestedbelow:
`require(!paused || whitelisted[from])`

## Proof of Concept
1. User A is inserted to the whitelist
2. User A wishes to transfer their tokens to User B
3. The transfer() reverts, resulting in lock of funds.
