# Votes manipulation in PoolVoter

Submitted on Mar 4th 2024 at 18:33:40 UTC by @DuckAstronomer for [Boost | ZeroLend](https://immunefi.com/bounty/zerolend-boost/)

Report ID: #29012

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: High

Target: https://github.com/zerolend/governance

Impacts:
- Manipulation of governance voting result deviating from voted outcome and resulting in a direct change from intended effect of original results

## Description
## Vulnerability Details
**Affected asset**: https://github.com/zerolend/governance/blob/main/contracts/voter/PoolVoter.sol

`PoolVoter` contract allows to vote for the Gauge for anyone who has voting power by staking in the `VestedZeroNFT`.

The `vote()` function allows to specify pools associated with gauges and their respective weights.

```
function vote(
    address[] calldata _poolVote,
    uint256[] calldata _weights
) external {}
```

However, a crucial flaw exists as the function fails to check for repeated pools in the `_poolVote` array. Moreover, it only considers the last weight if the same pool is utilized, as seen here - https://github.com/zerolend/governance/blob/main/contracts/voter/PoolVoter.sol#L117.

```
if (_gauge != address(0x0)) {
    _updateFor(_gauge);
    _usedWeight += _poolWeight;
    totalWeight += _poolWeight;
    weights[_pool] += _poolWeight;
    poolVote[_who].push(_pool);
    votes[_who][_pool] = _poolWeight;  // !!!
}
```

When a voter calls the `reset()` function to retrieve their voting power back and vote for another gauge, only the last weight is taken into account in case of repeated pool voting.

As a result, the voter recovers the full voting power. Yet `totalWeight` and `weights[_pool]` are decreased only by the last element from the `_weights` array passed to the `vote()`.

```
uint256 _votes = votes[_who][_pool];

if (_votes > 0) {
    _updateFor(gauges[_pool]);
    totalWeight -= _votes;
    weights[_pool] -= _votes;
    votes[_who][_pool] = 0;
}
```

**Attack scenario**:
1. The attacker possesses a voting power of `19.01 ether`.
2. They invoke `vote()` to vote for the same gauge with the following parameters:
    - _poolVote = [gauge, gauge]
    - _weights = [19 ether, 1e8]
3.  Further they call `reset()`, but `weights[_pool]` and `totalWeight` are only decreased by `1e8`.
4. The attacker retains the full `19.01 ether` voting power. But `weights[_pool]` and `totalWeight` are now increased by `19 ether`.
5. By repeating steps 2-3 in a loop many times, the attacker can consolidate the majority of votes for their chosen gauge, and all rewards will be distributed to it.
6. By repeating steps 2-3 for **100** times, it's tantamount to having `1900 ether` voting power.


## Proof of Concept
To run the Poc put it's code to the `governance-main/test/PoolVoter.poc.ts` file, generate random private key, and issue the following command:

```
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... NODE_ENV=test npx hardhat test test/PoolVoter.poc.ts --config hardhat.config.ts --network hardhat
```

```
import { expect } from "chai";
import { loadFixture } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers";
import { SignerWithAddress } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import {
  GaugeIncentiveController,
  OmnichainStaking,
  Pool,
  PoolVoter,
  StakingBonus,
  TestnetERC20,
  VestedZeroNFT,
  ZeroLend,
} from "../typechain-types";
import { e18 } from "./fixtures/utils";
import { deployVoters } from "./fixtures/voters";

// Put inside governance-main/test/PoolVoter.poc.ts

// Run as:
// WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... NODE_ENV=test npx hardhat test test/PoolVoter.poc.ts --config hardhat.config.ts --network hardhat
