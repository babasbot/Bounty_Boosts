# Alchemix : The first epoch's ALCX emissions of voter contract will be stuck forever.

Submitted on May 20th 2024 at 13:23:00 UTC by @Norah for [Boost | Alchemix](https://immunefi.com/bounty/alchemix-boost/)

Report ID: #31494

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: High

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/Voter.sol

Impacts:
- Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield

## Description
## Brief/Intro
- During each epoch, the minter contract distributes emissions to various components of the Alchemix system, one of them being the voter contract.
- Anyone can call the `distribute()` function on the voter contract. If the minter period/epoch is over, the rewards are distributed to the various gauges, and `minter.updatePeriod()` is called, which triggers the minter contract to distribute the emissions for the previous epoch.

## Vulnerability Details
- The problem arises if the `_distribute()` function is called first and then `minter.updatePeriod()`. I
      - In this scenario, during the first epoch, since there are no emissions at this point, no rewards will be distributed.
      - Afterward, `minter.updatePeriod()` will be triggered, sending the rewards to the voter contract.
- However, the rewards distribution routine has already been called, so no reward will be transferred to the contract or updated in the claimable[_gauge] mapping for the gauges to claim later on.
     - Essentially, there is emissions are now stuck in the `voter` contract forever.
-  Ideally, minter.updatePeriod() should be called first, to allow the minter contract to send the rewards, and then the _distribute() routine should be called to distribute and update the rewards in claimable or send them directly to the gauge
- For more detail check POC.

## Impact Details
- As a result, the rewards for the first epoch will be forever stuck in the voter contract, and gauges will be unable to claim these rewards.
- This will result in the permanent freezing of yield (emissions) for the gauges.

## Recommendation
- Update the code of the `distribute()` routine so that `IMinter(minter).updatePeriod()` is called before `_distribute().`
- Also, remove the timestamp check from `_distribute()` and place it in `distribute()`.

```
 function distribute() external {
+++     require(  block.timestamp >= IMinter(minter).activePeriod() IMinter(minter).DURATION(), "can only distribute after period end" );

+++      IMinter(minter).updatePeriod();

            uint256 start = 0;
            uint256 finish = pools.length;

            for (uint256 x = start; x < finish; x++) {
                // We don't revert if gauge is not alive since pools.length is not reduced
                if (isAlive[gauges[pools[x]]]) {  _distribute(gauges[pools[x]]); } 
---    IMinter(minter).updatePeriod();

        }
```


```
   function _distribute(address _gauge) internal {
--- require( block.timestamp >= IMinter(minter).activePeriod() + IMinter(minter).DURATION(),  "can only distribute after period end");

        uint256 _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
        // Reset claimable amount
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;

        _updateFor(_gauge);

        if (_claimable > 0) {
            IBaseGauge(_gauge).notifyRewardAmount(_claimable);
        }

        IBribe(bribes[_gauge]).resetVoting();

        emit DistributeReward(msg.sender, _gauge, _claimable);
    }

```



## Proof of Concept

I have created a test showcasing how the rewards sent during the first epoch are stuck in the voter contract for 3 epochs.

- For better understanding, re-run the test after implementing the recommended changes.
- Note that there will still be a lag between gauge_balance and claimable_amount (i.e., gauge_balance will be updated in the next epoch each time), but that is due to a different bug.
- Add the test below to the voting.t.sol file of the test suite and run it with the following command:    
     - forge test --fork-url https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/{Alchemy-api-key} --match-test "testFirstEpochRewardsStuck" -vvv

        alcx.transfer(address(0xdead),alcx.balanceOf(address(sushiGauge.receiver())));
        vm.stopPrank();
