Report ID: #31575

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Medium

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value
- Theft of unclaimed yield

## Description
## Title
`depositIntoRewardPool()` and  `withdrawFromRewardPool()` in `RewardPoolManager`  are missing slippage control mechanism

## Vulnerability Details
The `RewardPoolManger` is meant to be compatible with ERC4626. The `depositIntoRewardPool()` and `withdrawFromRewardPool()` functions are used to deposit and withdraw funds with Aura Pools and the shares and tokens are minted  but as it is pool deposit, there is always fluctuations in the ratio deposit to mint or burn to withdraw.  The the issue is these two functions don't implement any slippage mechanism to avoid such ratio drop. At worst case, the MEV attacks such as frontrunning the transaction can make loss of shares while depositing and loss of tokens while withdrawing. 
`RewardPoolHandler::depositIntoRewardPool` :
```solidity
    function depositIntoRewardPool(uint256 _amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(msg.sender == veALCX, "must be veALCX");

        IERC20(poolToken).approve(rewardPool, _amount);
    
@>      IRewardPool4626(rewardPool).deposit(_amount, address(this));
        return true;
    }
```umm
`RewardPoolHandler::withdrawFromRewardPool` :

```solidity
    function withdrawFromRewardPool(uint256 _amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(msg.sender == veALCX, "must be veALCX");

@>      IRewardPool4626(rewardPool).withdraw(_amount, veALCX, address(this));
        return true;
    }

```
## Impact Details
Users will loss tokens or shares due to not handling the slippage case. At worst, MEV may make user loss a huge amount of funds.

## Recommendation
Implement proper slippage control mechanism in these two functions to avoid the mentioned issue.



## Proof of Concept 
Attack is straightforward and POC for Mev attacks are hard to simulate.
