Submitted on May 17th 2024 at 07:32:47 UTC by @Minato7namikazi for [Boost | Alchemix](https://immunefi.com/bounty/alchemix-boost/)

Report ID: #31329

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Critical

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/Voter.sol

Impacts:
- Unauthorized minting of NFTs

## Description
## Brief/Intro

Attacker can gain infinitive FLUX by repeating this attack!



## Vulnerability Details

in the reset function in Voter contract which could be used only once per epoch , it accrueFlux for the tokenID and add the accrued amount in the unclaimed Flux balance , using the following scenario a malicious attacker could accrueFlux for tokenID already accrued previously in the same epoch.

### an example scenario 

an attaker have 3 locks each one with 100k token 

**ID1**

**ID2**

**ID3**

#### In the first epoch

he vote with the three tokenIDs

#### in the next epoch 

he reset the voting for ID1 & ID2 
and accrue their Flux ratio

fortunately here for the attacker ... the reset function abstain the voting status for the token id so it will be !VOTED

and the attacker will be able to merge into token voted in the previous epoch and didn't use reset in the new epoch yet 

because merge() only require   ```   require(!voted[_from], "voting in progress for token");   ```

it doesn't require the merged "to" token to be not voted .. only the first token 

the attacker now could merge ID1 & ID2  to  ID3 

and use the reset function with the new total balance .. 
and accrue flux even if the same IDs tokens balance accrued flux previously in the same epoch!




## Impact Details

the suitable in-scope impact is **Unauthorized minting of NFTs**
because this will enable an attacker to gain infinitive FLUX by repeating this tricky scenario
