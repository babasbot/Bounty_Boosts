Report ID: #31277

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/AlchemixGovernor.sol

Impacts:
- Manipulation of governance voting result deviating from voted outcome and resulting in a direct change from intended effect of original results

## Description
## Brief/Intro
The user can propose with less voting power than proposalThreshold.

## Vulnerability Details
This error arises from the difference between the timing of calculating votingPower and proposalThreshold.

L2Governor.sol
```
require(
            getVotes(_msgSender(), block.timestamp - 1) >= proposalThreshold(),
            "Governor: veALCX power below proposal threshold"
        );
```
the votingPower is calculated at `block.timestamp - 1`.

but 
```
function proposalThreshold() public view override(L2Governor) returns (uint256) {
        return (token.getPastTotalSupply(block.timestamp) * proposalNumerator) / PROPOSAL_DENOMINATOR;
    }
```
`proposalThreshold` is calculated at `block.timestamp`
In `block.timestamp`, `VotingEscrow.totalSupplyAtT` becomes smaller than at `block.timestamp - 1` point.
If a withdraw occurs at this point, it makes more changes.
An attacker may artificially carry out withdraw to make the `VotingEscrow.totalSupplyAtT` smaller.
Or the attacker can propose in the same transaction as soon as a user withdraw a large amount.

## Impact Details
By lowering the minimum unit price to create an offer, it makes it easier for an attacker to generate a malicious offer.
