# Certain small amount of tokens are not accounted for when deposited

Report ID: #31544

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: High

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/VotingEscrow.sol

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value
- Temporary freezing of funds for 12 hours

## Description
## Brief/Intro
When a sufficiently small amount of tokens is deposited and locked as veALCX it is not included into the bias due to division by `iMAXTIME`

## Vulnerability Details
When a new slope is calculated at `_checkpoint()` the difference in bias is divided through timestamp. If the value is smaller than the timestamp the result of division is zero, hence no bias increase is added to the checkpoint.

## Impact Details
The Voting power of a user is not increased despite increased deposit. While the impact is minuscule as the amount of tokens that can be lost is so small. It still affects the correctness of accounting. It should be fairly easy to prevent that from happening by establishing a minimum deposit requirement.

## Proof of Concept
Paste the following code into `Voting.t.sol`:
```
    function testVEVotePower4() public {
        //uint256 tokenId1 = createVeAlcx(admin, 15768000 - 1, 40 weeks, false);
        uint256 tokenId1 = createVeAlcx(admin, TOKEN_1, 40 weeks, false);

        // Add BAL bribes to sushiGauge
        address bribeAddress = voter.bribes(address(sushiGauge));
        createThirdPartyBribe(bribeAddress, bal, TOKEN_1);

        // epoch 1
        hevm.warp(newEpoch());
        voter.distribute();
        

        console.log("Votes for admin before deposit before: %d", veALCX.getVotes(admin));
        depositFor(tokenId1, 1_000_000);
        console.log("Votes for admin after deposit after:  %d", veALCX.getVotes(admin));

        (uint256 amount,,,) = veALCX.locked(tokenId1);
        console.log("Locked amount: %d:", amount);
    }
```
We can see that that the amount of votes didn't change after additional tokens were deposited into a veALCX:
