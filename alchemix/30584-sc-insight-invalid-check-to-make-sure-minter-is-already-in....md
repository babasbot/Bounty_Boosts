# Invalid check to make sure Minter is already initialized

Report ID: #30584

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/Minter.sol

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Brief/Intro
- A meaningless check

## Vulnerability Details
- In `Minter.initialize` function, there is this check `require(msg.sender != address(0), "already initialized");` that is supposed to make sure it throws an error Minter is already initialized. This check is meaningless.  
- msg.sender won't ever be equal to address(0). There is no circumstance where this error will be thrown. 
- If the error is moved before `require(initializer == msg.sender, "not initializer");` and updated with  `require(initializer != address(0), "already initialized");` in that case it makes sense. It will now throw an error that Minter is already initialized if someone (including the previous initializer) tries to initialise it again.

```solidity
  function initialize() external {
        require(initializer != address(0), "already initialized");
        require(initializer == msg.sender, "not initializer");
        initializer = address(0);
    }
```

## Impact Details
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value
- A useful error won't ever be thrown if it is left as it is.

## Proof of Concept

- Take a look at [this](https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/test/Minter.t.sol#L343) test. 
    - It has to impersonate the address(0) for the error to be thrown. In real environment this won't be possible.
