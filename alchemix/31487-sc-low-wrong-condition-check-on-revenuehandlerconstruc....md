# Wrong condition check on RevenueHandler::constructor breaks invariant and allows to bypass maximum BPS value for treasury pct

Report ID: #31487

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Low

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/RevenueHandler.sol

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Brief/Intro
The RevenueHandler constructor performs a wrong condition check allowing to break BPS maximum value (10_000) implemented invariant and bypass maximum BPS value leading to set tresuary pct to arbitrary value so failing to fulfill expected restrictions set for example in RevenueHandler::setTreasuryPct    

## Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability exists in RevenueHandler::constructor because wrongly checks the contract treasuryPct variable instead of constructor parameter value:    
```js
constructor(address _veALCX, address _treasury, uint256 _treasuryPct) Ownable() {
    veALCX = _veALCX;
    require(_treasury != address(0), "treasury cannot be 0x0");
    treasury = _treasury; 
    require(treasuryPct <= BPS, "treasury pct too large"); //<@ Wrong check
    treasuryPct = _treasuryPct;
 }
```
So parameter `_treasuryPct` coult be an arbitrary value , instead of maximum 10_000 value that is performed for eg in RevenueHandler::setTreasuryPct, and will be assigned as treasury pct.    

## Impact Details
The impact of this vulnerability includes:  
1. Bypass of maximum pct of treasury and breaking contract enviroment asumptions  

### Risk Breakdown  
The vulnerability is fairly easy to exploit leading to breaking BPS invariant, but can only occour during constructor.  
Also, the setted value can be modified using RevenueHandler::setTreasuryPct method.  
Overall Risk Severity:	Low  
Likelihood: 			Medium  
Impact: 				Low

## Proof of Concept
To show the vulnerability  
Add this test on src/test/RevenueHandler.t.sol  
```js
    function testTreasuryPctLimitBypass() external {
        RevenueHandler revenueHandler2;
        revenueHandler2 = new RevenueHandler(address(veALCX),admin,12345678987654321);
        console.log("revenueHandler2.treasuryPct ",revenueHandler2.treasuryPct());
    }
```
Run test with  
```bash
reset ; forge compile  ; forge test --deny-warnings --fork-url https://rpc.ankr.com/eth --fork-block-number 17133822 --mt testTreasuryPctLimitBypass -vv
```
Observe revenueHandler2.treasuryPct is more than the intended max allowed (10_000) and bypass restriction checks implemented in RevenueHandler::setTreasuryPct
