# "The proposer can be impeded from submitting a proposal by an attacker who inflates the proposalThreshold."

Report ID: #30685

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Medium

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/AlchemixGovernor.sol

Impacts:
- Manipulation of governance voting result deviating from voted outcome and resulting in a direct change from intended effect of original results

## Description
## Brief/Intro
The `propose` function verifies the minimum votes required for a valid proposal by checking if the number of votes obtained by `_msgSender()` within the last block timestamp is greater than or equal to the current `proposalThreshold()` value. However, it is susceptible to exploitation by an attacker who can manipulate and inflate the `proposalThreshold()` value, thereby preventing any user from successfully proposing a valid proposal.


## Vulnerability Details
In the `propose` function, there exists a verification mechanism ensuring that the `msg.sender` possesses adequate quorum votes to initiate a proposal, denoted by the condition `getVotes(_msgSender(), block.timestamp - 1) >= proposalThreshold()`. Here, the `getVotes()` function retrieves the number of votes at `block.timestamp - 1`, while the `proposalThreshold()` is calculated as follows: `(token.getPastTotalSupply(block.timestamp) * proposalNumerator) / PROPOSAL_DENOMINATOR`. Notably, `getPastTotalSupply()` fetches the `totalSupply` at the specified `block.timestamp`.

Consider the following hypothetical scenario:
1. Bob intends to propose a proposal.
2. At timestamp `x`, Bob garners 110 votes.
3. At timestamp `x + 1`, the actual `proposalThreshold` is set at 100 votes.
4. However, Alice opposes Bob's proposal.
5. Alice manipulates the `proposalThreshold` by either locking or depositing assets into an already locked position, thereby ensuring that `getVotes(bob, x) < proposalThreshold()`. Consequently, Bob's proposal transaction fails, leading to a revert.

This scenario underscores a vulnerability where an adversary, in this case, Alice, exploits the system by artificially inflating the `proposalThreshold`, effectively obstructing legitimate proposals such as Bob's from succeeding.

## Impact Details
Opposing an user from proposing by manipulating the `totalSupply`
