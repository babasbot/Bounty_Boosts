# Incorrect Validation of `treasuryPct` in the `RevenueHandler` Constructor

Submitted on May 9th 2024 at 23:24:07 UTC by @The_Seraphs for [Boost | Alchemix](https://immunefi.com/bounty/alchemix-boost/)

Report ID: #30973

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Low

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/RevenueHandler.sol

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value
- Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds
- Protocol insolvency

## Description
## Brief/Intro
The constructor of the `RevenueHandler` contract incorrectly checks an uninitialised state variable (`treasuryPct`) instead of the parameter (`_treasuryPct`). This issue could lead to setting an unintended treasury percentage without proper validation.

**Note:** _I've set as a medium severity, due to setting an incorrect treasury percentage could lead to financial discrepancies in revenue distribution between the Treasury and veALCX holders - Ultimately affecting the protocol's economic model. However, I do understand that this is part of a constructor, so the likelihood is **low** and the `setTreasuryPct()` can be used to fix once noticed._

## Vulnerability Details
### Components Affected
* Contract Name: `RevenueHandler`
* Functionality: Constructor and Treasury Percentage Setup

## Impact Details
The constructor of the `RevenueHandler` contract is intended to initialise the treasury percentage (`treasuryPct`) used to calculate the portion of revenues sent to the treasury. The code currently checks the uninitialised state variable `treasuryPct` instead of the input parameter `_treasuryPct`. The correct line should validate `_treasuryPct` as it's the input provided during contract deployment and affects subsequent financial calculations.

If not corrected, this bug could allow the initialisation of the `RevenueHandler` with a `treasuryPct` exceeding 100%. This could lead to errors in calculating the treasury's share of revenues, potentially resulting in economic losses or unintended distribution of funds.

**Current implementation:**
```solidity
    constructor(address _veALCX, address _treasury, uint256 _treasuryPct) Ownable() {
        veALCX = _veALCX;
        require(_treasury != address(0), "treasury cannot be 0x0");
        treasury = _treasury;
        require(treasuryPct <= BPS, "treasury pct too large"); // incorrect check
        treasuryPct = _treasuryPct;
    }
```
**Proposed fix:**
```solidity
    constructor(address _veALCX, address _treasury, uint256 _treasuryPct) Ownable() {
        veALCX = _veALCX;
        require(_treasury != address(0), "treasury cannot be 0x0");
        treasury = _treasury;
        require(_treasuryPct <= BPS, "treasury pct too large"); // corrected
        treasuryPct = _treasuryPct;
```

## Proof of Concept
* Using the existing `src/test/RevenueHandler.t.sol` test contract
* Add the following test function
```solidity
    function testRevenueHandlerTreasuryPct() public {
        uint256 treasuryPct = revenueHandler.treasuryPct();
        console.log("Treasury percentage: %s", treasuryPct);
    }
```
* Go to the `BaseTest.sol` test contract and adjust setUp() which initiates the `RevenueHandler` with the required parameters.
```solidity=153
        revenueHandler = new RevenueHandler(address(veALCX), admin, 50000); // @audit change to higher than BPT
```
* Run the test from the terminal
`forge test --mt testRevenueHandlerTreasuryPct -vv`
