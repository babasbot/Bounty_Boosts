# ALCX rewards aren't claimed for "from" token when merging

Submitted on May 19th 2024 at 02:47:23 UTC by @OxAlix2 for [Boost | Alchemix](https://immunefi.com/bounty/alchemix-boost/)

Report ID: #31435

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: High

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/VotingEscrow.sol

Impacts:
- Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Brief/Intro
In `VotingEscrow::withdraw`, the protocol is claiming the ALCX rewards before burning the token, which makes sense as the token will be burnt. However, this is not done when merging 2 tokens, this puts the ALCX rewards of the "from" token at risk of being stuck forever.

## Vulnerability Details
When merging 2 tokens, token_1, and token_2, assume that token_1 has some unclaimed ALCX rewards, through the merge process token_1 will be burnt. So all these unclaimed ALCX will remain stuck forever as `RewardsDistributor::claim` will revert on the following:
```
require(approvedOrOwner || isVotingEscrow, "not approved");
```
because the token doesn't exist anymore.

## Impact Details
ALCX rewards that were accumulated for the "from" token will remain unclaimable/stuck forever after the merge process.

## Mitigation
Add the following in `VotingEscrow::merge`:
```
IRewardsDistributor(distributor).claim(_from, false);
```


## Proof of concept
```
function testALCXRewardsNotClaimedOnMerge() public {
    uint256 tokenId1 = createVeAlcx(admin, TOKEN_1, MAXTIME, false);
    uint256 tokenId2 = createVeAlcx(admin, TOKEN_1, MAXTIME, false);

    hevm.warp(minter.activePeriod() + nextEpoch);
    voter.distribute();

    assertGt(distributor.claimable(tokenId1), 0);
    assertGt(distributor.claimable(tokenId2), 0);

    hevm.prank(admin);
    veALCX.merge(tokenId1, tokenId2);

    assertGt(distributor.claimable(tokenId1), 0);
    assertGt(distributor.claimable(tokenId2), 0);

    vm.prank(admin);
    vm.expectRevert(abi.encodePacked("not approved"));
    distributor.claim(tokenId1, false);
}
```
