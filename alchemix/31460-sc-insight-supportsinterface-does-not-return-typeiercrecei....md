## Description
## Brief/Intro
`supportsInterface()` does not return `type(IERC721Receiver).interfaceId`

## Vulnerability Details
`AlchemixGovernor.sol` contract has inherited `L2Governor` abstract as base contract. This base contract has `supportsInterface()` function which returns the supported interface id by Alchemix Governor contract. It should be noted that Alchemix governor contract supports both `IERC721Receiver` interface id and `IERC1155Receiver` interface id, however, the implementation of `supportsInterface` has only returned `IERC1155Receiver` and does not return the `IERC721Receiver` interface id and this can be seen as below:

```solidity
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override(IERC165, ERC165) returns (bool) {
        // In addition to the current interfaceId, also support previous version of the interfaceId that did not
        // include the castVoteWithReasonAndParams() function as standard
        return
            interfaceId ==
            (type(IGovernor).interfaceId ^
                this.castVoteWithReasonAndParams.selector ^
                this.castVoteWithReasonAndParamsBySig.selector ^
                this.getVotesWithParams.selector) ||
            interfaceId == type(IGovernor).interfaceId ||
            interfaceId == type(IERC1155Receiver).interfaceId ||
            super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
```
## Impact Details
`supportsInterface()` does not explicitely return the `interfaceId == type(IERC721Receiver).interfaceId` while calling it. The Alchemix governor supports the ERC721Receiver but the interface id does not return it so its a low severity issue

## Recommendation to fix

```diff
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override(IERC165, ERC165) returns (bool) {
        // In addition to the current interfaceId, also support previous version of the interfaceId that did not
        // include the castVoteWithReasonAndParams() function as standard
        return
            interfaceId ==
            (type(IGovernor).interfaceId ^
                this.castVoteWithReasonAndParams.selector ^
                this.castVoteWithReasonAndParamsBySig.selector ^
                this.getVotesWithParams.selector) ||
            interfaceId == type(IGovernor).interfaceId ||
+          interfaceId == type(IERC721Receiver).interfaceId ||
            interfaceId == type(IERC1155Receiver).interfaceId ||
            super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
```



## Proof of Concept

The issue is simple to understand and very straight forward. It explains the interfaceId function unable to return the promised return i.e `interfaceId == type(IERC721Receiver).interfaceId` as true. 

The issue is not complex so i believe it can be easily understood with above description and recommendation.

Thank you for your understanding.
